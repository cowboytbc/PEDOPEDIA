Upon information and belief, Defendant Library Genesis Project is an\norganization which operates an online repository of copyrighted materials accessible through the\nwebsite located at the URL “libgen.org” as well as a number of other “mirror” websites\n(collectively the “Libgen Domains”). The libgen.org domain is registered by “Whois Privacy\nCorp.,” located at Ocean Centre, Montagu Foreshore, East Bay Street, Nassau, New Providence,\n2\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 1 Filed 06/03/15 Page 3 of 16\nBahamas, to an unknown registrant. As of the date of this filing, libgen.org is assigned the IP\naddress 93.174.95.71.

Upon information and belief, Defendant Alexandra Elbakyan is the principal\nowner and/or operator of Sci-Hub. Upon information and belief, Elbakyan is a resident of\nAlmaty, Kazakhstan.\n9. Elsevier is unaware of the true names and capacities of the individuals named as\nDoes 1-99 in this Complaint (together with Alexandra Elbakyan, the “Individual Defendants”),\nand their residence and citizenship is also unknown. Elsevier will amend its Complaint to allege\nthe names, capacities, residence and citizenship of the Doe Defendants when their identities are\nlearned.\n10. Upon information and belief, the Individual Defendants are the owners and\noperators of numerous of websites, including Sci-Hub and the websites located at the various\nLibgen Domains, and a number of e-mail addresses and accounts at issue in this case.\n11. The Individual Defendants have participated, exercised control over, and\nbenefited from the infringing conduct described herein, which has resulted in substantial harm to\nthe Plaintiffs.\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\n12. This is a civil action arising from the Defendants’ violations of the copyright laws\nof the United States (17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq.) and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (“CFAA”),\n3\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 1 Filed 06/03/15 Page 4 of 16\n18.U.S.C. § 1030. Therefore, the Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C. § 1331.\n13. Upon information and belief, the Individual Defendants own and operate\ncomputers and Internet websites and engage in conduct that injures Plaintiff in this district, while\nalso utilizing instrumentalities located in the Southern District of New York to carry out the acts\ncomplained of herein.\n14. Defendants have affirmatively directed actions at the Southern District of New\nYork by utilizing computer servers located in the District without authorization and by\nunlawfully obtaining access credentials belonging to individuals and entities located in the\nDistrict, in order to unlawfully access, copy, and distribute Elsevier's copyrighted materials\nwhich are stored on Elsevier’s ScienceDirect platform.\n15. Defendants have committed the acts complained of herein through unauthorized\naccess to Plaintiffs’ copyrighted materials which are stored and maintained on computer servers\nlocated in the Southern District of New York.\n16. Defendants have undertaken the acts complained of herein with knowledge that\nsuch acts would cause harm to Plaintiffs and their customers in both the Southern District of\nNew York and elsewhere. Defendants have caused the Plaintiff injury while deriving revenue\nfrom interstate or international commerce by committing the acts complained of herein.\nTherefore, this Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants.\n17. Venue in this District is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because a substantial\npart of the events giving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in this District and because the\nproperty that is the subject of Plaintiffs’ claims is situated in this District.\n4\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 1 Filed 06/03/15 Page 5 of 16\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\nElsevier’s Copyrights in Publications on ScienceDirect\n18. Elsevier is a world leading provider of professional information solutions in the\nScience, Medical, and Health sectors. Elsevier publishes, markets, sells, and licenses academic\ntextbooks, journals, and examinations in the fields of science, medicine, and health. The\nmajority of Elsevier’s institutional customers are universities, governmental entities, educational\ninstitutions, and hospitals that purchase physical and electronic copies of Elsevier’s products and\naccess to Elsevier’s digital libraries. Elsevier distributes its scientific journal articles and book\nchapters electronically via its proprietary subscription database “ScienceDirect”\n(www.sciencedirect.com). In most cases, Elsevier holds the copyright and/or exclusive\ndistribution rights to the works available through ScienceDirect. In addition, Elsevier holds\ntrademark rights in “Elsevier,” “ScienceDirect,” and several other related trade names.\n19. The ScienceDirect database is home to almost one-quarter of the world's peer-\nreviewed, full-text scientific, technical and medical content. The ScienceDirect service features\nsophisticated search and retrieval tools for students and professionals which facilitates access to\nover 10 million copyrighted publications. More than 15 million researchers, health care\nprofessionals, teachers, students, and information professionals around the globe rely on\nScienceDirect as a trusted source of nearly 2,500 journals and more than 26,000 book titles.\n20. Authorized users are provided access to the ScienceDirect platform by way of\nnon-exclusive, non-transferable subscriptions between Elsevier and its institutional customers.\nAccording to the terms and conditions of these subscriptions, authorized users of ScienceDirect\nmust be users affiliated with the subscriber (e.g., full-time and part-time students, faculty, staff\n5\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 1 Filed 06/03/15 Page 6 of 16\nand researchers of subscriber universities and individuals using computer terminals within the\nlibrary facilities at the subscriber for personal research, education or other non-corporate use.)\n21. A substantial portion of American research universities maintain active\nsubscriptions to ScienceDirect. These subscriptions, under license, allow the universities to\nprovide their faculty and students access to the copyrighted works within the ScienceDirect\ndatabase.\n22. Elsevier stores and maintains the copyrighted material available in ScienceDirect\non servers owned and operated by a third party whose servers are located in the Southern District\nof New York and elsewhere. In order to optimize performance, these third-party servers\ncollectively operate as a distributed network which serves cached copies of Elsevier’s\ncopyrighted materials by way of particular servers that are geographically close to the user. For\nexample, a user that accesses ScienceDirect from a University located in the Southern District of\nNew York will likely be served that content from a server physically located in the District.\nAuthentication of Authorized University ScienceDirect Users\n23. Elsevier maintains the integrity and security of the copyrighted works accessible\non ScienceDirect by allowing only authenticated users access to the platform. Elsevier\nauthenticates educational users who access ScienceDirect through their affiliated university’s\nsubscription by verifying that they are able to access ScienceDirect from a computer system or\nnetwork previously identified as belonging to a subscribing university.\n24. Elsevier does not track individual educational users’ access to ScienceDirect.\nInstead, Elsevier verifies only that the user has authenticated access to a subscribing university.\n25. Once an educational user authenticates his computer with ScienceDirect on a\nuniversity network, that computer is permitted access to ScienceDirect for a limited amount of\n6\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 1 Filed 06/03/15 Page 7 of 16\ntime without re-authenticating. For example, a student could access ScienceDirect from their\nlaptop while sitting in a university library, then continue to access ScienceDirect using that\nlaptop from their dorm room later that day. After a specified period of time has passed, however,\na user will have to re-authenticate his or her computer’s access to ScienceDirect by connecting to\nthe platform through a university network.\n26. As a matter of practice, educational users access university networks, and thereby\nauthenticate their computers with ScienceDirect, primarily through one of two methods. First,\nthe user may be physically connected to a university network, for example by taking their\ncomputer to the university’s library. Second, the user may connect remotely to the university’s\nnetwork using a proxy connection. Universities offer proxy connections to their students and\nfaculty so that those users may access university computing resources – including access to\nresearch databases such as ScienceDirect – from remote locations which are unaffiliated with the\nuniversity. This practice facilitates the use of ScienceDirect by students and faculty while they\nare at home, travelling, or otherwise off-campus.\nDefendants’ Unauthorized Access to University Proxy Networks to Facilitate Copyright\nInfringement\n27. Upon information and belief, Defendants are reproducing and distributing\nunauthorized copies of Elsevier’s copyrighted materials, unlawfully obtained from\nScienceDirect, through Sci-Hub and through various websites affiliated with the Library Genesis\nProject. Specifically, Defendants utilize their websites located at sci-hub.org and at the Libgen\nDomains to operate an international network of piracy and copyright infringement by\ncircumventing legal and authorized means of access to the ScienceDirect database. Defendants’\npiracy is supported by the persistent intrusion and unauthorized access to the computer networks\n7\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 1 Filed 06/03/15 Page 8 of 16\nof Elsevier and its institutional subscribers, including universities located in the Southern District\nof New York.\n28. Upon information and belief, Defendants have unlawfully obtained and continue\nto unlawfully obtain student or faculty access credentials which permit proxy connections to\nuniversities which subscribe to ScienceDirect, and use these credentials to gain unauthorized\naccess to ScienceDirect.\n29. Upon information and belief, Defendants have used and continue to use such\naccess credentials to authenticate access to ScienceDirect and, subsequently, to obtain\ncopyrighted scientific journal articles therefrom without valid authorization.\n30. The Sci-Hub website requires user interaction in order to facilitate its illegal\ncopyright infringement scheme. Specifically, before a Sci-Hub user can obtain access to\ncopyrighted scholarly journals, articles, and books that are maintained by ScienceDirect, he must\nfirst perform a search on the Sci-Hub page. A Sci-Hub user may search for content using either\n(a) a general keyword-based search, or (b) a journal, article or book identifier (such as a Digital\nObject Identifier, PubMed Identifier, or the source URL).\n31. When a user performs a keyword search on Sci-Hub, the website returns a proxied\nversion of search results from the Google Scholar search database.1 When a user selects one of\nthe search results, if the requested content is not available from the Library Genesis Project, Sci-\nHub unlawfully retrieves the content from ScienceDirect using the access previously obtained.\nSci-Hub then provides a copy of that article to the requesting user, typically in PDF format. If,\nhowever, the requested content can be found in the Library Genesis Project repository, upon\n1 Google Scholar provides its users the capability to search for scholarly literature, but does not provide the\nfull text of copyrighted scientific journal articles accessible through paid subscription services such as\nScienceDirect. Instead, Google Scholar provides bibliographic information concerning such articles along with a\nlink to the platform through which the article may be purchased or accessed by a subscriber.\n8\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 1 Filed 06/03/15 Page 9 of 16\ninformation and belief, Sci-Hub obtains the content from the Library Genesis Project repository\nand provides that content to the user.\n32. When a user searches on Sci-Hub for an article available on ScienceDirect using a\njournal or article identifier, the user is redirected to a proxied version of the ScienceDirect page\nwhere the user can download the requested article at no cost. Upon information and belief, Sci-\nHub facilitates this infringing conduct by using unlawfully-obtained access credentials to\nuniversity proxy servers to establish remote access to ScienceDirect through those proxy servers.\nIf, however, the requested content can be found in the Library Genesis Project repository, upon\ninformation and belief, Sci-Hub obtains the content from it and provides it to the user.\n33. Upon information and belief, Sci-Hub engages in no other activity other than the\nillegal reproduction and distribution of digital copies of Elsevier’s copyrighted works and the\ncopyrighted works of other publishers, and the encouragement, inducement, and material\ncontribution to the infringement of the copyrights of those works by third parties – i.e., the users\nof the Sci-Hub website.\n34. Upon information and belief, in addition to the blatant and rampant infringement\nof Elsevier’s copyrights as described above, the Defendants have also used the Sci-Hub website\nto earn revenue from the piracy of copyrighted materials from ScienceDirect. Sci-Hub has at\nvarious times accepted funds through a variety of payment processors, including PayPal,\nYandex, WebMoney, QiQi, and Bitcoin.\nSci-Hub’s Use of the Library Genesis Project as a Repository for Unlawfully-Obtained\nScientific Journal Articles and Books\n35. Upon information and belief, when Sci-Hub pirates and downloads an article from\nScienceDirect in response to a user request, in addition to providing a copy of that article to that\nuser, Sci-Hub also provides a duplicate copy to the Library Genesis Project, which stores the\n9\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 1 Filed 06/03/15 Page 10 of 16\narticle in a database accessible through the Internet. Upon information and belief, the Library\nGenesis Project is designed to be a permanent repository of this and other illegally obtained\ncontent.\n36. Upon information and belief, in the event that a Sci-Hub user requests an article\nwhich has already been provided to the Library Genesis Project, Sci-Hub may provide that user\naccess to a copy provided by the Library Genesis Project rather than re-download an additional\ncopy of the article from ScienceDirect. As a result, Defendants Sci-Hub and Library Genesis\nProject act in concert to engage in a scheme designed to facilitate the unauthorized access to and\nwholesale distribution of Elsevier’s copyrighted works legitimately available on the\nScienceDirect platform.\nThe Library Genesis Project’s Unlawful Distribution of Plaintiff’s Copyrighted Works\n37. Access to the Library Genesis Project’s repository is facilitated by the website\n“libgen.org,” which provides its users the ability to search, download content from, and upload\ncontent to, the repository. The main page of libgen.org allows its users to perform searches in\nvarious categories, including “LibGen (Sci-Tech),” and “Scientific articles.” In addition to\nsearching by keyword, users may also search for specific content by various other fields,\nincluding title, author, periodical, publisher, or ISBN or DOI number.\n38. The libgen.org website indicates that the Library Genesis Project repository\ncontains approximately 1 million “Sci-Tech” documents and 40 million scientific articles. Upon\ninformation and belief, the large majority of these works is subject to copyright protection and is\nbeing distributed through the Library Genesis Project without the permission of the applicable\nrights-holder. Upon information and belief, the Library Genesis Project serves primarily, if not\n10\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 1 Filed 06/03/15 Page 11 of 16\nexclusively, as a scheme to violate the intellectual property rights of the owners of millions of\ncopyrighted works.\n39. Upon information and belief, Elsevier owns the copyrights in a substantial\nnumber of copyrighted materials made available for distribution through the Library Genesis\nProject. Elsevier has not authorized the Library Genesis Project or any of the Defendants to\ncopy, display, or distribute through any of the complained of websites any of the content stored\non ScienceDirect to which it holds the copyright. Among the works infringed by the Library\nGenesis Project are the “Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology,” and the article “The\nVarus Ankle and Instability” (published in Elsevier’s journal “Foot and Ankle Clinics of North\nAmerica”), each of which is protected by Elsevier’s federally-registered copyrights.\n40. In addition to the Library Genesis Project website accessible at libgen.org, users\nmay access the Library Genesis Project repository through a number of “mirror” sites accessible\nthrough other URLs. These mirror sites are similar, if not identical, in functionality to\nlibgen.org. Specifically, the mirror sites allow their users to search and download materials from\nthe Library Genesis Project repository.\nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n(Direct Infringement of Copyright)\n41. Elsevier incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1-40\nabove.\n42. Elsevier’s copyright rights and exclusive distribution rights to the works available\non ScienceDirect (the “Works”) are valid and enforceable.\n43.

I submit this affidavit in support of Plaintiffs’ application for entry of a\npreliminary injunction.\n2. I am the Vice President for Global Intellectual Property Management at John\nWiley & Sons, Inc. (“Wiley”). My office address is 111 River Street, Hoboken, New Jersey,\n07030.\n3. Wiley is a leading global publishing company that specializes in academic\npublishing and markets its products to researchers, instructors, and students in scientific,\ntechnical, medical, and scholarly fields. Wiley currently publishes more than 1,600 scholarly\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 10 Filed 06/11/15 Page 2 of 5\njournals and approximately 160,000 articles annually in those journals. Wiley is also a leading\npublisher of scholarly books, publishing approximately 1,300 books annually.\n4. Wiley operates the Wiley Online Library, accessible at onlinelibrary.wiley.com.\nThrough the Wiley Online Library, Wiley provides its authorized users access to scientific works\nit publishes. Wiley is either the owner of the copyright or the exclusive licensee of the copyright\nin all of the works it makes available through the Wiley Online Library with the minimal\nexception of those that are published originally as “open access.”\n5. I am familiar with the piracy websites sci-hub.org (“Sci-Hub”) and libgen.org (the\n“Library Genesis Project”). Based on my review of Wiley content on these sites, I believe that\nthey have no substantial purpose other than to engage in, and facilitate the infringement of,\ncopyrighted works. They do this via sci-hub.org, which has compromised user credentials of\nWiley’s licensed customers to obtain Wiley’s copyrighted content. They then post the content\nto libgen.org, which is accessible to anyone who visits libgen.org and is designed to be the\nultimate and permanent repository of the content obtained.

Wiley has not authorized Sci-Hub or the Library Genesis Project to access its\nonline databases or to copy, display, or distribute its copyrighted works through their websites.\nRather, these websites have gained access to Wiley’s online databases through unauthorized\nmeans. These methods may include using compromised user credentials from a licensed\ncustomer and either entering the secure network via a proxy server or directly to an individual\ncomputer; using phishing scams to obtain users’ credentials; infecting a computer with malware\nto obtain access to the secure network; buying user credentials on the web; deploying keystroke\nviruses which capture all of the work a user does on his or her computer, including seeing his or\nher use of the user credentials; and using botnets to automatically and virtually undetectably\nenter a customer’s secure network. Wiley has not found any way to protect our customers\nagainst the threat of Sci-Hub’s and the Library Genesis Project’s unlawful intrusion into their\ncomputer systems.\n7. Wiley has undertaken significant effort in attempting to remove its copyrighted\nworks from the Library Genesis Project’s repository through the DMCA notice-and-takedown\nregime. These efforts, however, have largely been ignored or ineffective.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 10 Filed 06/11/15 Page 5 of 5",

I am the Senior Director, Product Design at The Institute of Electrical and\nElectronics Engineers (“IEEE”). My office address is 501 Hoes Lane, Piscataway, New Jersey\n08854.\n3. IEEE is a not-for-profit technical professional association of more than 400,000\nindividual members in over 160 countries. It is recognized as a leading authority in many\ntechnical subjects, most notably, electrical and electronics engineering. As part of its efforts to\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 11 Filed 06/11/15 Page 2 of 3\npromote those fields of endeavor, IEEE makes over 3.6 million documents available for purchase\nthrough its digital library, IEEE Xplore. IEEE Xplore is also provided to customers in a\nsubscription model so that all of their technical needs can be met. IEEE is either the owner of\nthe copyright or the licensee of the copyright in all of the works it makes available through IEEE\nXplore with the minimal exception of those that are published originally as “open access.”\n4. I am familiar with the piracy websites sci-hub.org (“Sci-Hub”) and libgen.org (the\n“Library Genesis Project”). Based on my review of IEEE content on these sites, I believe that\nthey have no substantial purpose other than to engage in, and facilitate the infringement of,\ncopyrighted works. They do this via sci-hub.org, which has compromised user credentials of\nIEEE’s licensed customers to obtain IEEE’s copyrighted content. They then post the content to\nlibgen.org, which is accessible to anyone who visits libgen.org and appears to be designed to be\nthe ultimate and permanent repository of the content obtained. These works include, but are not\nlimited to, the following examples:\n IEEE Wireless Communications, Vol. 18, No. 1 ,” which is\navailable through Libgen.org at\nhttp://libgen.org/search.php?req=A%20Publication%20of%20the\n%20IEEE%20Communications%20Society&column[]=author\n IEEE Spectrum, Vol. 48, Issue 11 which is available through\nLibgen.org at\n http://libgen.org/book/index.php?md5=E4918C8F5FBAD9382AA\nE86362CDD9E54\n IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, Vol. 22, No. 1 which is\navailable through Libgen.org at\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 11 Filed 06/11/15 Page 3 of 3",

As usual, the Sci-Hub project is doing a monthly collection for the project needs.\nTotal Collected\nThis will cover our monthly costs of university proxy, for the period between March 15, 2015 and collected today:\nApril 15, 2015, as well as hosting subscription for one month.\n$ 2485 $2144\nIt is important to know that these costs will not be recurrent, for two reasons: the first one - additions\nof articles to the library has been very active (during the last two months, 3.5 million new articles\nwere added, the frequency of loading continuing to rise) - which means that in the future, there will\nno longer be any need to download most articles through the proxy, but simply from the library. The\nsecond reason is that we have been developing our technology which will allow us to operate without\na proxy.\nHowever, for now, the proxy is still required so please do contribute. Bearing in mind the number of\nour readership, the amount of individual contribution does not have to be large. If each Russian user\ngives us at least twenty five Roubles, we will collect the required amount in one week. So please do\nnot be lazy. Go to Sberbank or use YandexMoney site to wire your contribution.\nEach Rouble received will make it possible to acquire several new articles or books.\nTransfer methods:\nMethod one: Russian bank cards: go to Yandex card2card service and indicate the following receiving\ncard number 4276 3800 9449 2282 and click on \"send\".\nMethod two: Send using the form:\nMethod three: Transfer to electronic wallet No. QIWI 7 929 9309965\nMethod four: Send directly to Sberbank card No.: 4276 3800 9449 2282\nComrades!

In this post I’m going to talk about the creator of the Sci-Hub project, that is, about myself. Due to recent\nevents, my identity has become entangled in gossip and rumors, which is why this post is necessary. I’ll say right\naway that I not only created Sci-Hub four years ago, but since that time I have done absolutely all (ninety-eight\npercent) of the programming work on the site by myself.\nMy name is Aleksandra Elbakian, I am 26 years old, and I currently live in Russia. However, I was born in\nKazakhstan and I graduated college-preparatory school and college with a major in Information Technology with a\nfocus on security. In addition to computer science, I enjoy studying neural sciences. Due to of this, my thesis was on\nthe treatment of electroencephalograms. After graduation, I managed to work abroad as a programmer-researcher in\nseveral laboratories.\nEven before writing my thesis, I encountered the problem of access to scientific literature. Then I solved it, finding\nan English-language forum where they disseminated proxies of foreign universities. I donated 50 dollars to them and\nreceived access.\nWhen I returned to Kazakhstan I discovered that for political reasons access to LiveJournal was closed. The provider\nsimply would not open the site. So I had to use special anonymizer sites that let you get around blocks: all you had\nto do was copy the link, paste it on the site and it would open.\nFor some time I sat in on a forum for students of MolBiol. The big thing about this forum was the section on Full\nText. There, anyone who needed to could parse together a query on an article that didn’t open, and indicate their\naddress. Any member of the forum who had access to the article could send the full text to the address of the person\nsoliciting it and close the query.\nSince I had access to literature since my thesis-writing days, I began to actively help those in need. However,\ndownloading each article manually took a lot of time. Then I decided to set up a university proxy so that people\ncould download articles on their own, but then I encountered a problem: it was difficult for most people to\nunderstand how proxies worked, and they preferred the old method. Moreover, proxies with open access didn’t\nsurvive long. Another difficulty was that it would take quite a while to sort through proxies before locating the one\nthat provided access to an article. Doing this manually was an onerous task.\nAnd so I decided: why not make a site where one could simply post a link to an article and it would automatically\nopen? Right in front of me was an example, in the form of the anonymizer sites that provided access to LiveJournal.\nThe idea turned out to be realizable, and a slew of queries immediately rained down on the site and were\nsuccessfully handled, and also gratitude. This was on September 5, 2011.\nAfter creating the site the first time, I gave up everything else and worked only on implementing various fixes on it.\nSubsequently, it began to work in a more or less stable fashion, but I constantly made changes and improvements to\nthe code.\nSince this text has turned out to be rather long, I’ll write the rest of my story tomorrow. But here I am in the photo.\nSince some people like to speculate about the level of my intellect, let me tell you: as I already said at the beginning,\nI am fond of neurobiology and the general principles of thinking. So I have measured my own IQ several times\nusing various tests. The results have varied, but are always above 120.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 12-6 Filed 06/11/15 Page 6 of 6\nDated June 2, 2015:\nTranslation:\nSci-Hub | Open access to scientific information replied to Maria Chernysheva\nMaria, the Libgen library is being updated with articles uploaded by Sci-Hub. In addition to articles uploaded at the\nrequest of users, Sci-Hub itself verifies what articles are still not in the library and will complete uploading them.\nJun 2 at 4:29 am |  10",

In support of\ntheir request, Amici state as follows:\n1. Amici represent a wide array of technology companies that provide online\nservices to billions of people around the world. Amici’s members include Internet search\nengines, Internet Service Providers, and companies that provide web hosting and other\ncore Internet services.\n2. The Computer & Communications Industry Association (“CCIA”) represents\nmore than 20 large, medium-sized, and small companies in the high technology products\nand services sectors, including computer hardware and software, electronic commerce,\ntelecommunications, and Internet products and services. The Internet Commerce Coalition\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 20 Filed 06/26/15 Page 2 of 3\n(“ICC”) works to promote policies that allow service providers, their customers, and other\nusers to do business on the global Internet under reasonable rules governing liability and\nuse of technology that encourage the growth of this vital medium.\n3. In this case, Plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction that would impose\nobligations directly on a wide variety of online intermediaries, including amici’s members.\nPlaintiffs’ proposed injunction would require online services – including “Internet search\nengines, Web Hosting, and Internet Service Providers” – to “cease facilitating access to any\nor all . . . websites through which Defendants engage in unlawful access to, use,\nreproduction, and distribution of Elsevier’s copyrighted works.” None of those service\nproviders are party to this case, and none of them are accused of violating any law.\n4. If granted in the form that Plaintiffs have proposed, this injunction would\nhave significant consequences for amici and their members. The attached amicus brief\nexplains that Plaintiffs’ request to enjoin nonparty online service providers violates Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 65, is barred by the “safe harbor” provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright\nAct, and is not authorized by the All Writs Act.\n5. An amicus brief “should normally be allowed” in instances “when the amicus\nhas unique information or perspective that can help the court beyond the help that the\nlawyers for the parties are able to provide.” Auto.

Plaintiffs make no showing that these nonparties have\nviolated any legal obligation, much less infringed any of Plaintiffs’ copyrights.\nWhat Plaintiffs here are seeking is, in essence, an injunction against the world. It\nis well established that such a sweeping injunction against nonparty intermediaries is\nimpermissible, overstepping the bounds of Fed. R. Civ. P. 65 and the All Writs Act.\nIndeed, even if Plaintiffs had named these service providers as defendants and\nsomehow obtained infringement judgments against them, the Digital Millennium\nCopyright Act (DMCA) would bar the relief that Plaintiffs seek in their proposed\ninjunction. Remedies that Plaintiffs could not obtain after a final judgment against a\nparty should patently not be available in the form of a preliminary injunction against\ninnocent nonparties.\nAmici represent a wide array of technology companies that provide online\nservices to billions of people, including Neutral Service Providers that might be swept\nup by Plaintiffs’ proposed injunction. Amici’s members recognize the importance of\ncombating copyright infringement online, and many of them work closely with\nrightsholders, including Plaintiffs, against rogue sites that distribute infringing material.\nBut in their zeal to pursue the Defendants here, Plaintiffs ignore the established limits\non judicial power and the balance struck by Congress in the DMCA. Those protections\ncannot be swept aside so readily. Plaintiffs do not need, and should not be allowed, to\n“[c]ut a great road through the law to get after the Devil.” Tennessee Valley Auth. v. Hill,\n437 U.S. 153, 195 (1978) (quoting Robert Bolt, A Man For All Seasons).\n-1-\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 20-1 Filed 06/26/15 Page 6 of 20\nINTERESTS OF THE AMICI\nThe Computer & Communications Industry Association (“CCIA”) represents\nmore than 20 large, medium-sized, and small companies in the high technology\nproducts and services sectors, including computer hardware and software, electronic\ncommerce, telecommunications, and Internet products and services—companies that\ncollectively generate more than $465 billion in annual revenues. A list of CCIA\nmembers, including a number of online service providers that could be swept up in\nPlaintiffs’ proposed injunction, is available at https://www.ccianet.org/members.\nThe Internet Commerce Coalition (“ICC”) works to promote policies that allow\nservice providers, their customers, and other users to do business on the global Internet\nunder reasonable rules governing liability and use of technology that encourage the\ngrowth of this vital medium. The ICC’s mission is to encourage a legal environment\nunder which ISPs, customers, and other users can do business on the global Internet\nunder reasonable rules governing liability and use of technology.\nAmici and their members have a compelling interest in ensuring the rules\nlimiting injunctions against online services are scrupulously followed, particularly in\ncases where those services are not parties. In this case, Plaintiffs seek an injunction that\nwould directly bind Neutral Service Providers as nonparties, despite their having\nviolated no laws. If the proposed order is granted, these service providers may be\ncompelled to purge or block information—and indeed entire websites and Internet\ndomains—from their services and could face contempt proceedings if they decline.\nAmici submit this brief to explain why such an order would be unlawful and unwise.\nThere are certainly ample reasons to strike the language from the proposed\ninjunction that targets Neutral Service Providers. Plaintiffs’ memorandum of points and\nauthorities, for example, fails to lay any foundation for those provisions of the\ninjunction. Moreover, Plaintiffs have failed to provide proper notice to those it purports\nto bind with that language. But amici urge the Court not only to strike the impermissible\n-2-\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 20-1 Filed 06/26/15 Page 7 of 20\nprovisions, but also to issue a clear ruling setting out the limits on such injunctions\nagainst nonparty intermediaries. Defending against such orders in contempt\nproceedings is an expensive and poor substitute for preventing their issuance in the first\ninstance. A ruling from the Court in this case making clear that Plaintiffs’ proposed\ninjunction goes too far would assist other courts facing similarly overbroad requests for\npreliminary injunctions or other orders against nonparty service providers.\nARGUMENT\nI. FRCP 65 Does Not Allow An Injunction Against Nonparty Neutral Service\nProviders Or Similar Online Services\nAs nonparties to this case, Neutral Service Providers can be bound by an\ninjunction only insofar as they are working “in active concert or participation” with\nDefendants. Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(2)(C). This strict standard requires clear evidence that\nthe nonparty is directly working to help the defendant evade an injunction. Plaintiffs do\nnot even try to make that showing. Nor could they.\nA. “Active Concert or Participation” Is Required To Bind A Nonparty\nIt is a basic rule of due process that “one is not bound by a judgment in personam\nin a litigation in which he is not designated as a party or to which he has not been made\na party by service of process.” Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U.S. 32, 40 (1940). As the Second\nCircuit has explained, a court is “not vested with sovereign powers to declare conduct\nunlawful; its jurisdiction is limited to those over whom it gets personal service, and\nwho therefore can have their day in court.” Alemite Mfg. Corp. v. Staff, 42 F.2d 832, 832-\n33 (2d Cir. 1930) (Hand, J.). Thus, the “only occasion when a person not a party may be\npunished, is when he has helped to bring about, not merely what the decree has\nforbidden, because it may have gone too far, but what it has power to forbid, an act of a\nparty.” Id. at 833.\nRule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure codifies this “well-established\nprinciple that, in exercising its equitable powers, a court ‘cannot lawfully enjoin the\n-3-\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 20-1 Filed 06/26/15 Page 8 of 20\nworld at large.’” New York v. Operation Rescue Nat’l, 80 F.3d 64, 70 (2d Cir. 1996) (quoting\nAlemite Mfg., 42 F.2d at 832); see also, e.g., United States v. Regan, 858 F.2d 115, 120 (2d Cir.\n1988) (“a court generally may not issue an order against a nonparty”). The Rule\nmandates that an injunction can bind only a limited universe of people: (1) the parties;\n(2) their “officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys”; or (3) those in “active\nconcert or participation” with them. Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(2); see Zenith Radio Corp. v.\nHazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 112 (1969) (“a nonparty with notice cannot be held\nin contempt until shown to be in concert or participation”).\nThe “active concert or participation” standard is deliberately narrow. Its purpose\nis simply to ensure that “defendants may not nullify a decree by carrying out prohibited\nacts through aiders and abettors.” Regal Knitwear Co. v. NLRB, 324 U.S. 9, 14 (1945);\naccord Alemite Mfg., 42 F.2d at 833 (“it is not the act described which the decree may\nforbid, but only that act when the defendant does it”) (emphasis added). The relationship\nbetween the party and the nonparty must be “that of associate or confederate.” Chase\nNat’l Bank v. City of Norwalk, 291 U.S. 431, 436-37 (1934); see also Microsystems Software,\nInc. v. Scandinavia Online AB, 226 F.3d 35, 43 (1st Cir. 2000) (“active concert” requires a\n“close alliance with the enjoined defendant”). That ensures that “[a] nonparty who has\nacted independently of the enjoined defendant will not be bound by the injunction.”\nMicrosystems Software, 226 F.3d at 43.\nB. Amici and Other Service Providers Cannot Be Enjoined Because They Are\nNot In Active Concert With Defendants\nPlaintiffs’ proposed injunction includes some language that incorporates Rule\n65’s limitations. Dkt. 5, at 5 (¶ 1) (injunction would apply to “the Defendants, their\nofficers, directors, principals, agents, servants, employees, successors and assigns, and\nall persons and entities in active concert or participation with them”). The provisions of\nthe proposed injunction that apply to Neutral Service Providers, in contrast, pointedly\nlack any mention of a limitation to those who “act in concert” with or “aid and abet” the\n-4-\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 20-1 Filed 06/26/15 Page 9 of 20\nDefendants. Id. at 5-6 (¶¶2-6). These provisions sweep far beyond the limits of Rule 65.\nThe Neutral Service Providers are not parties in this action, and Plaintiffs make no\nshowing that any such Providers are in “active concert or participation” with any\nDefendant.\nPlaintiffs offer no evidence that any of these intermediaries have done anything\nthat would satisfy Rule 65(d)(2)(C). The complaint in this case includes no such\nallegations, and, other than a cursory reference to certain top-level domain registries\n(Dkt. 6 at 25-26), Plaintiffs have submitted no evidence in support of their motion for a\npreliminary injunction.1 In the absence of such evidence—which in order to satisfy due\nprocess would have to be presented in a proceeding where those entities were given an\nopportunity to be heard (see generally Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339\nU.S. 306, 313 (1950))—the Court cannot enter an order that purports to bind them. See,\ne.g., Zenith Radio, 395 U.S. at 112 (“It was error to enter the injunction against Hazeltine,\nwithout having made [the ‘active concert or participation’] determination in a\nproceeding to which Hazeltine was a party.”); Bobolas v. Does, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS\n110856, at *6-7 (D. Ariz. Aug. 1, 2010) (“Plaintiff’s counsel argued that GoDaddy is an\nagent of Defendants given its role as website host and domain name registrar, but\nPlaintiff has made no such allegation in the complaint and provides no factual or legal\nproof on this point in its papers. As a result, the Court cannot enter a TRO against\nGoDaddy.”).\nBeyond this procedural problem is a more fundamental substantive one. The\nintermediaries at issue here are not sufficiently connected to Defendants’ alleged\nillegality to be subject to the Court’s injunctive power. Consider, for example, the search\n1 In light of Plaintiffs’ statement that one top-level domain registry (Public Interest\nRegistry) has indicated “that it will comply with a Court order directing it to disable\nDefendants’ domain names” (Dkt. 6 at 25), amici take no position as to whether an\ninjunction could or should apply to those services.\n-5-\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 20-1 Filed 06/26/15 Page 10 of 20\nengines that are targeted by the proposed injunction. These services catalogue an\nenormous array of material from all over the Internet in order to return results that they\nbelieve are most responsive to their users’ search queries. See generally Perfect 10, Inc. v.\nAmazon.com, Inc., 508 F.3d 1146, 1155 (9th Cir. 2007). Even assuming that links to\nDefendants’ websites or other information about their activities are sometimes included\nin those results, that would not remotely suggest that the search engines are\n“confederates” of the Defendants, “aiders and abettors,” or are working together with\nthem to violate the law. Indeed, search engines provide search results to their billions of\nusers independently of anything Defendants do. Including Defendants’ website among\nthe hundreds of millions that a search engine indexes cannot make the search engine a\n“participant” in Defendants’ alleged illegality, any more than a mapmaker can be said\nto “participate” by including Defendants’ physical address on a map. See, e.g.,\nParamount Pictures Corp. v. Carol Publ’g Grp., 25 F. Supp. 2d 372 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (book\nretailers not “in active concert” with infringing publisher by selling previously\npurchased copies of infringing book).\nBlockowicz v. Williams, 630 F.3d 563 (7th Cir. 2010), is instructive. In that case, the\nSeventh Circuit held that the operators of a nonparty website (Ripoff Report) could not\nbe bound by an injunction against users of its service who posted defamatory comments\nabout the plaintiffs. The court reached that conclusion even though Ripoff Report had a\ncontractual agreement with the defendants governing their use of the site and even\nthough Ripoff Report continued to provide service to the defendants by leaving their\nmaterial up on its website after the injunction issued. Id. at 567-68. The court explained\nthat Ripoff Report’s actions simply did not amount to “active concert or participation”\nunder Rule 65. Id. at 569-70 (“Rule 65(d)(2)(C) is not broad enough to bind [the website\noperators] to the terms of this injunction in light of their inactivity.”).\nThe Neutral Service Providers here are several steps further removed from\nDefendants than Ripoff Report was from its users in Blockowicz. Plaintiffs have failed to\n-6-\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 20-1 Filed 06/26/15 Page 11 of 20\nmake a showing that any such provider had a contract with these Defendant or any\ndirect contact with their activities—much less that all of the providers who would be\nswept up by the proposed injunction had such a connection. The mere fact that one or\nmore of the Neutral Service Providers might have the capacity to impede access to\nDefendants’ websites is not enough. As a matter of law, the fact that a service provider\n“is technologically capable of removing the postings does not render its failure to do so\naiding and abetting.” Id. at 568. “Rule 65 (d)(2)(C) is not the appropriate mechanism for\nachieving the removal of the defendants’ posts.” Id. at 569.2\n* * *\nAn injunction cannot apply to “independent action taken by nonparties on their\nown behalf.” Carol Publ’g, 25 F. Supp. 2d at 375. That is the situation here. Under Rule\n65, amici and other online services operating independently from Defendants—not as\ntheir confederates in a scheme to frustrate the Court’s orders—must be excluded from\nany injunction in this case.\n2 In a recent decision, Judge Nathan held an injunction against an infringing website\ncould apply to CloudFlare—a nonparty service provider that contracted with the\ndefendants to translate their websites’ domain names into IP addresses and to provide\noptimization services to those sites. Arista Records LLC v. Tkach, No. 15-cv-3701-AJN,\nDkt. 58 (S.D.N.Y. June 3, 2015). While amici respectfully disagree with Judge Nathan’s\nruling, it is readily distinguishable from this case. The key point emphasized in Tkach\nwas that CloudFlare entered into an agreement to start providing services to the\nDefendants only after it had received notice of the injunction. Id. at 8. Moreover, the\ncourt suggested that CloudFlare did not just provide passive hosting, but actively\nserviced defendants’ websites by ensuring that their IP addresses remained linked to\ntheir domain names and by optimizing their performance for faster load times. Id. Even\nassuming these considerations are meaningful, they only confirm that an injunction\nagainst Neutral Service Providers and similar providers would not be appropriate here.\nAs explained, unlike CloudFlare there is no evidence of any relationship between\nDefendants and any Neutral Service Provider. Thus, even under Tkach’s logic,\ncontinuing to operate their services as they were prior to an injunction would not\namount to “active concert.”\n-7-\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 20-1 Filed 06/26/15 Page 12 of 20\nII. Plaintiffs Cannot Circumvent The DMCA By Seeking Broad Ex Parte\nInjunctive Relief Against Search Engines And Similar Services\nPlaintiffs’ bid for a sweeping injunction against nonparty intermediaries runs\nheadlong into another obstacle: the DMCA safe harbors. The DMCA imposes strict\nlimits on the injunctions that can be issued against online service providers—even after\nthey have been found liable for copyright infringement. And even in that circumstance, the\nstatute categorically prohibits the relief that Plaintiffs seek here. The DMCA expresses\nCongress’s intent that concerns about infringement on the Internet be resolved through\nvoluntary cooperation between service providers and copyright owners, not by broad\ncourt orders issued without notice. It cannot be that a remedy prohibited even after a\nfinding of copyright liability against a party could be available via a preliminary\ninjunction against the same entity in the role of a nonparty accused of violating no law.\nA. The DMCA Protects Online Service Providers Against Copyright Liability\nand Strictly Limits The Injunctions That Can Be Imposed\nThe DMCA was enacted in 1998 to “update domestic copyright law for the\ndigital age.” Viacom Int’l, Inc. v. YouTube, Inc., 676 F.3d 19, 26-27 (2d Cir. 2012). A key\npart of that project was to “clarify the liability faced by service providers who transmit\npotentially infringing material over their networks.’” Id. at 27 (quoting S. REP. NO. 105-\n190, at 2 (1998)). Congress recognized that “in the ordinary course of their operations\nservice providers must engage in all kinds of acts that expose them to potential\ncopyright infringement liability.” S. REP. NO. 105-190, at 8. By limiting providers’ “legal\nexposure for infringements that may occur in the course of their activities” (Amazon, 508\nF.3d at 1158), the “DMCA ensures that the efficiency of the Internet will continue to\nimprove and that the variety and quality of services on the Internet will continue to\nexpand.” S. REP. NO. 105-190, at 8.\nTo that end, Congress created a series of “safe harbors for certain common\nactivities of service providers.” Id. at 19. The safe harbors “allow qualifying service\n-8-\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 20-1 Filed 06/26/15 Page 13 of 20\nproviders to limit their liability for claims of copyright infringement based on (a)\n‘transitory digital network communications,’ (b) ‘system caching,’ (c) ‘information\nresiding on systems or networks at [the] direction of users,’ and (d) ‘information\nlocation tools.’” Viacom, 676 F.3d at 27 (quoting 17 U.S.C. § 512(a)-(d)). The DMCA safe\nharbors offer far-reaching protection: “A service provider that qualifies for such\nprotection is not liable for monetary relief and may be subject only to the narrow\ninjunctive relief set forth in section 512(j).” Amazon, 508 F.3d at 1158; see also S. REP. NO.\n105-190, at 52-53 (section 512(j) expressly “limits the scope of injunctive relief that may\nbe ordered against a qualifying provider”).\nThis means that even if a qualifying online service provider is found liable for\ninfringement, the only remedies available to the plaintiff are those permitted by the\nDMCA. S. REP. NO. 105-190, at 40 (explaining that the DMCA’s “limitations on liability\napply if the provider is found to be liable under existing principles of law”). A service\nprovider does not need a safe harbor from remedies if it has not violated the law—in\nthat case, no remedies would be available at all. The DMCA thus puts bedrock limits on\nthe injunctions that can be imposed on qualifying providers (such as the Neutral Service\nProviders here) if they are named as defendants and are held liable as infringers. See\nCoStar Grp., Inc. v. LoopNet, Inc., 373 F.3d 544, 555 (4th Cir. 2004) (“Congress intended\nthe DMCA’s safe harbor for ISPs to be a floor, not a ceiling, of protection.”).3 Plaintiffs\nhere ignore that. What they seek, in the posture of a preliminary injunction against\nnonparties, goes beyond what Congress was willing to permit, even against service\n3 Likewise, the DMCA’s provisions limiting injunctive relief supplement the\nordinary rules governing injunctions. See S. REP. NO. 105-190, at 52 (section 512(j)\n“defines the terms and conditions under which an injunction may be issued against a\nservice provider” that is “otherwise subject to an injunction under existing principles of\nlaw”). They thus provide an additional set of procedural and substantive protections to\nservice providers beyond, for example, the limits imposed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 65.\n-9-\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 20-1 Filed 06/26/15 Page 14 of 20\nproviders who come before a court as defendants against whom an actual judgment of\ninfringement has been entered. That request must be rejected.\nThe DMCA provides that a “court may grant injunctive relief with respect to a\nservice provider only in one or more” of the forms set out in the statute. 17 U.S.C.\n§ 512(j)(1) (emphasis added). That ensures that any injunction issued against a service\nprovider covered by the Section 512(b), (c), or (d) safe harbors focuses narrowly on\n“material or activity residing at a particular online site” (§512(j)(1)(A)(i)), and is the\n“least burdensome to the service provider among the forms of relief comparably\neffective for that purpose” (§512(j)(1)(A)(iii)). For providers covered by Section 512(a),\nwhich include those who transmit material over the Internet or provide connections to\nwebsites, Congress imposed even more stringent limits. §512(j)(1)(B). Any order\ndirected at such providers in a case involving a foreign website must specify\n“reasonable steps” for the provider to take to block access “to a specific, identified, online\nlocation outside the United States.” §512(j)(1)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).\nIn order to further protect the interests and operations of service providers,\nSection 512(j)(2) “identifies factors a court must consider in deciding whether to grant\ninjunctive relief and in determining the appropriate scope of injunctive relief.” S. REP.\nNO. 105-190, at 53 (emphasis added). Those include:\n “whether such an injunction, either alone or in combination with other\nsuch injunctions issued against the same service provider under this subsection,\nwould significantly burden either the provider or the operation of the provider’s\nsystem or network” (§512(j)(2)(A));\n “whether other less burdensome and comparably effective means of\npreventing or restraining access to the infringing material are available”\n(§512(j)(2)(D)).\nBeyond all that, subsection (j) includes a vital procedural protection: “injunctive relief\nunder this subsection shall be available only after notice to the service provider and an\nopportunity for the service provider to appear are provided.” §512(j)(3). This provision\n-10-\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 20-1 Filed 06/26/15 Page 15 of 20\n“prohibits most forms of ex parte injunctive relief (including temporary and\npreliminary relief) against a service provider qualifying for a liability limitation under\nsection 512.” S. REP. NO. 105-190, at 53.\nB. Plaintiffs’ Requested Injunction Would Be Improper Even If The Neutral\nService Providers Were Culpable Defendants\nThe Neutral Service Providers targeted by Plaintiffs’ proposed injunction are all\n“service providers” that qualify for the protections of the DMCA safe harbors. 17 U.S.C.\n§ 512(k)(1); accord Wolk v. Kodak Imaging Network, Inc., 840 F. Supp. 2d 724, 744 (S.D.N.Y.\n2012) (“The DMCA’s definition of ‘service provider’ is intended to encompass a broad\nset of Internet entities.”). They perform various functions covered by the safe harbors.\nSearch engines provide “information location tools” that are protected by the Section\n512(d) safe harbor. S. REP. NO. 105-190, at 47 (“The term information location tools\nincludes, for example: a directory or index of online sites or material such as a search\nengine that identifies pages by specified criteria….”). “Web Hosting and Internet\nService Providers” store material uploaded by users (covered by the Section 512(c) safe\nharbor) and/or transmit information across their networks (covered by the Section\n512(a) safe harbor). See id. at 43 (examples of online “storage” covered by 512(c) include\n“providing server space for a user’s web site”); id. at 41 (Section 512(a) applies to\n“communications functions associated with sending digital communications of others\nacross digital networks, such as the Internet and other online networks”).\nAccordingly, if the Neutral Service Providers had been named as defendants—\nand had been found liable for copyright infringement for linking to, hosting, or\ntransmitting infringing material from Defendants’ websites—any injunction issued\nagainst those service providers would be subject to the requirements of 17 U.S.C.\n§ 512(j). But Plaintiffs here have not named any Neutral Service Provider as a\ndefendant. They have come forward with no allegations or evidence suggesting that\nany Neutral Service Provider is secondarily liable for any copyright infringements\n-11-\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 20-1 Filed 06/26/15 Page 16 of 20\noccurring on the Defendants’ websites. Nevertheless, Plaintiffs now seek a preliminary\ninjunction that purports to bind “any” Neutral Service Provider as a nonparty upon\nafter-the-fact notice of the injunction. That is not permissible. Copyright plaintiffs\ncannot obtain injunctions against online service providers as nonparties that would have\nbeen barred by the DMCA against those same service providers had they been\nadjudicated as culpable defendants. In their zeal to go after Defendants in this case, the\nPlaintiffs here seek just such a logic-defying result—one that would do unacceptable\nviolence to the balanced statutory scheme set out by Congress in the DMCA.4\nIII. Plaintiffs Cannot Use The All Writs Act To Bind Nonparty Service Providers\nPlaintiffs also cannot justify their request for an order binding nonparty service\nproviders using the All Writs Act. Dkt. 6 at 24-26. The All Writs Act is a narrow gap-\nfilling provision. It is “reserved for really extraordinary causes, such as a clear abuse of\ndiscretion or usurpation of judicial power.” 21A Karl Oakes, Fed. Proc., L. Ed. § 51:208\n(2015 ed.) (footnotes omitted). The Act does not apply here.\n4 Respecting the DMCA does not leave Plaintiffs without recourse. Not only might\nthey get an injunction against Defendants themselves, Plaintiffs can use the DMCA’s\nnotice-and-takedown regime to alert service providers to Defendants’ allegedly\ninfringing material. The statute creates a streamlined, non-judicial process for removing\nsuspected infringing material from online services and search engines. Copyright\nowners provide service providers with specified information (under penalty of perjury)\nabout particular infringing material on their systems (§512(c)(3)) or search results\n(§512(d)(3)). In response, the service provider will “expeditiously” remove the\nidentified material. §§ 512(c)(1)(C), 512(d)(3). The “DMCA notification regime works\nefficiently,” Viacom Int’l, Inc. v. YouTube, Inc., 718 F. Supp. 2d 514, 524 (S.D.N.Y. 2010),\naff’d in part & vacated in part, 676 F.3d 19 (2d Cir. 2012), giving clarity to service\nproviders and copyright owners while setting the stage for voluntary cooperation\nbetween them. By putting this process at the heart of the DMCA, Congress indicated its\npreference that service providers and copyright owners work together outside the\nformal legal process.\n-12-\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 20-1 Filed 06/26/15 Page 17 of 20\nA. The All Writs Act Is A Narrow Gap-Filling Provision That Cannot\nDisplace Other Laws And Cannot Be Used To Burden Third Parties\nEnacted in 1789, the All Writs Act authorizes federal courts to “issue all writs\nnecessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the\nusages and principles of law.” 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a). It is designed to fill “the interstices of\nfederal judicial power when those gaps threatened to thwart the otherwise proper\nexercise of federal courts’ jurisdiction.” Pa. Bureau of Correction v. United States Marshals\nServ., 474 U.S. 34, 41 (1985). Although the All Writs Act is flexible, there are several\nimportant limitations on how and when it can be applied.\nFirst, any order issued under the Act must aim narrowly at protecting the court’s\njurisdiction. “The Supreme Court has been careful to limit the All Writs Act to cases in\nwhich the requested relief is necessary to give effect to an order that the court is\nauthorized to grant, i.e., to cases in which the court could not otherwise discharge its\nassigned duties.” Additive Controls & Measurement Sys, Inc.. v. Flowdata, Inc., 96 F.3d\n1390, 1396 (Fed. Cir. 1996); see also, e.g., ITT Cmt’y Dev. Corp. v. Barton, 569 F.2d 1351,\n1359 (5th Cir. 1978) (“conduct not shown to be detrimental to the court’s jurisdiction or\nexercise thereof could not have been enjoined under the Act”). Without a clear nexus to\na court’s authority to exercise its jurisdiction, the fact that a party may be aided in\nenforcing its rights by an order is not sufficient. The All Writs Act is not “a mechanism\nfor the judiciary to give [a party] the investigative tools that Congress has not.” In re\nUnited States for an Order Authorizing the Use of a Pen Register, 396 F. Supp. 2d 294, 325\n(E.D.N.Y. 2005).\nSecond, while there is no per se rule against using the Act to bind a third party,\n“the assistance of the third party must be absolutely necessary.” United States v. Hall,\n583 F. Supp. 717, 719 (E.D. Va. 1984):\n[T]he extraordinary remedy of enjoining non-parties must be reserved for\nextraordinary cases, in which the activities of third parties threaten to\nundermine the court’s ability to render a binding judgment in the case\n-13-\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 20-1 Filed 06/26/15 Page 18 of 20\nbefore it. Nothing … suggests that the All Writs Act can be employed as a\ngeneral license for district courts to grant relief against non-parties\nwhenever such measures seem useful or efficient.\nAdditive Controls, 96 F.3d at 1396.\nThird, the Act does not allow courts “to issue ad hoc writs whenever compliance\nwith statutory procedures appears inconvenient or less appropriate.” Pa. Bureau, 474\nU.S. at 43. Thus, where “a statute specifically addresses the particular issue at hand, it is\nthat authority, and not the All Writs Act, that is controlling.” Id.; see, e.g., Syngenta Crop\nProtection, Inc. v. Henson, 537 U.S. 28 (2002) (holding that the Act may not be used to\nremove cases from state court where that is not authorized by the statute specifically\ngoverning removal). Nor can the Act override constitutional protections. In re United\nStates ex rel. an Order Authorizing Disclosure of Location Info. of a Specified Wireless\nTelephone, 849 F. Supp. 2d 526, 581-83 (D. Md. 2011) (“The government simply cannot\nuse the All Writs Act to circumvent the requirements of the Fourth Amendment…”).\nB. The All Writs Act Does Not Authorize An Injunction Here\nPlaintiffs’ invocation of the All Writs Act here transgresses these limits. Most\nobviously, the Act does not permit Plaintiffs to circumvent Rule 65 and the DMCA.\n“While the All Writs Act empowers a district court to fashion extraordinary remedies\nwhen the need arises, it does not authorize a district court to promulgate an ad hoc\nprocedural code whenever compliance with the Rules proves inconvenient.” Fla.\nMedical Ass’n, Inc. v. U. S. Dep’t of HEW, 601 F.2d 199, 202 (5th Cir. 1979) (“the All Writs\nAct does not free a district court from the restraints of Rule 65”). For a court to impose\ninjunctive relief that is specifically forbidden by the Rules of Civil Procedure and the\nfederal copyright laws would exceed the limited role of the All Writs Act. Just as parties\n“may not, by resorting to the All Writs Act, avoid complying with the statutory\nrequirements for removal” (Syngenta, 537 U.S. at 32-33), rightsholders may not invoke\n-14-\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 20-1 Filed 06/26/15 Page 19 of 20\nthe Act as an end-run around the statutory requirements for obtaining injunctions\nagainst online service providers.\nMoreover, an order binding the Neutral Service Providers is not necessary to\nprotect the court’s jurisdiction. While the All Writs Act can be used to prevent third\nparties from “frustrat[ing] the implementation of a court order” (United States v. N.Y.\nTel. Co., 434 U.S. 159, 174 (1977)), that is not broad license to issue third-party writs\nwhenever it might assist a party in obtaining relief. Such orders must be tailored to\n“preserve the court’s ability to reach or enforce its decision” as against “non-parties\nwhose actions would impair the court’s jurisdiction.” In re Baldwin-United Corp., 770\nF.2d 328, 338-39 (2d Cir. 1985). That’s not the case here. Requiring search engines to\ndelete references to Defendants’ websites, for example, would not “curb conduct which\nthreaten[s] improperly to impede or defeat the subject matter jurisdiction then being\nexercised by the court.” Barton, 569 F.2d at 1359. Nor would an order requiring ISPs to\nblock their subscribers from accessing Defendants’ websites be needed to protect this\nCourt’s subject matter jurisdiction. Even if such an order helped Plaintiffs enforce their\ncopyrights, “‘[t]he fact that a party may be better able to effectuate its rights or duties if\na writ is issued never has been, and under the language of the statute cannot be, a\nsufficient basis for issuance of the writ.’” Id. at 1360 (quoting N.Y. Tel., 434 U.S. at 189\n(Stevens, J., dissenting)).\nFinally, the assistance of service providers is not “absolutely necessary” to\neffectuate any injunction the Court might issue. Hall, 583 F. Supp. at 719. In approving a\nthird-party writ in New York Telephone, the Supreme Court emphasized “that without\nthe Company’s assistance there is no conceivable way in which the surveillance\nauthorized by the District Court could have been successfully accomplished.” 434 U.S.\nat 175. That is not the case here. An injunction against the Defendants alone would be\nfully enforceable. There is no reason to think that such an order would fail unless the\nCourt goes further and imposes requirements directly on Neutral Service Providers.\n-15-\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 20-1 Filed 06/26/15 Page 20 of 20\nCONCLUSION\nFor these reasons, amici ask the Court to strike Paragraphs 2 and 6 from\nPlaintiffs’ proposed preliminary injunction, and to issue an order that would provide\nguidance to future courts faced with improper requests for injunctions against nonparty\nInternet intermediaries. In particular, the Court should make clear that Neutral Service\nProviders are not “in active concert and participation” with Defendants and that the\nDMCA does not allow, and the All Writ Act does not authorize, an injunction against\nsuch providers in circumstances such as these.\nDated: June 26 2015 Respectfully submitted,\ns/ Brian M.

Defendant Alexandra Elbakyan\n(\"Elbakyan\") participated in this telephone conference, although she has not otherwise entered an\nappearance. During such conference, Elbakyan indicated that she intends to defend this action, but\nis unable to afford an attorney.\nAs soon as possible, Elbakyan shall notify the Court whether she would like it to attempt\nto locate pro bona counsel to represent her in this matter, free of charge. She may do so by e-\nmailing the Court at Abrams_NYSDChambers@nysd.uscourts.gov and copying Plaintiffs at\njvd@devoredemarco.com. (She shall not utilize these e-mails for any other purposes, unless\nexpressly authorized by the Court.) To establish her qualification for pro bona counsel, her e-mail\nshould note her current financial condition, including her income from employment and any other\nsources, as well as any assets and liabilities. The Court's ability to fulfill any such request will\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 36 Filed 07/09/15 Page 2 of 2\ndepend on the availability of willing counsel, and the Court cannot assure that it can obtain her\nrepresentation, only that it will use its best efforts to do so.\nIf, instead, Elbakyan wishes to proceed prose, or without an attorney, she shall enter an\nappearance in this action, no later than July 13, 2015, by filing papers in opposition to Plaintiffs'\nmotion for a preliminary injunction. She may file such papers by contacting the Southern District's\nPro Se Intake Unit at+ 1 (212) 805-0175.\nAll other Defendants are cautioned that a default judgment may be entered against them if\nthey do not appear in or otherwise defend this action. Further, although individuals may appear\nprose, corporate entities may not do so and must retain counsel or risk default. See, e.g., Pridgen\nv. Andresen, 113 F.3d 391, 393 (2d Cir. 1997).\nA second telephone conference in this matter will be held on July 14, 2014 at 4:00 p.m.\n(EDT), as previously scheduled. At that time, the parties shall jointly call Chambers at + 1 (212)\n805-0162.

DeMARCO: How are you, Judge Abrams?\n4 THE COURT: Good. Thank you.\n5 MR. DeMARCO: I have you on you speaker phone, if\n6 that's okay. I'm here with two of my colleagues, David\n7 Hirschberg and Kate Tsyukin, who are attorneys at the firm.\n8 THE COURT: Thank you, Mr. DeMarco.\n9 I have a court reporter here. I will note for the\n10 record that we worked together at the U.S. Attorney's Office,\n11 so that will be on the transcript here.\n12 Look, as you know, I will be handling the July 21st\n13 preliminary injunction in this matter. I'm on Part 1, and I\n14 believe you have been made aware that Judge Sweet will be out\n15 of town.\n16 MR. DeMARCO: Yes, your Honor.\n17 THE COURT: I wanted to touch base beforehand and\n18 discuss logistics and the procedure. Obviously, that will\n19 depend, in part, on if defendants appear.\n20 Other than the newspaper article that you sent in,\n21 have you heard at all from the defendants or have any reason to\n22 believe that they intend to appear in this action?\n23 MR. DeMARCO: We have not heard from them. We have no\n24 reason to believe that they will appear.\n25 THE COURT: All right. I will just note for the\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 38 Filed 07/14/15 Page 3 of 18 3\nF774ElsC\n1 record that it looks as though plaintiffs have successfully\n2 served all defendants with the preliminary injunction materials\n3 at this point, and pursuant to Local Rule 6.1, defendants had\n4 14 days in which to file any opposition papers, which has\n5 expired.\n6 Let me ask you this: Have you heard anything from\n7 amici following your letter in which you indicate that you no\n8 longer intend to seek the relief requested in paragraphs 2 and\n9 6 of the original order?\n10 MR. DeMARCO: I have not, your Honor.\n11 THE COURT: So I will tell you generally how I\n12 proceed, although again if defendants don't appear on Tuesday,\n13 there will likely be less to do in person at the hearing.\n14 Pursuant to my individual rules -- and to the extent you\n15 haven't looked at them, I encourage you to do so -- unless\n16 parties make a formal request otherwise, all direct testimony\n17 comes in by way of affidavit. But if you wanted a witness to\n18 be heard live on direct, you would make an application to me in\n19 advance. Either way, that person has to be available for\n20 cross-examination in the event that defendants intend to\n21 cross-examine the witnesses. Again, since defendants have not\n22 yet appeared, I don't think that will be necessary, but I just\n23 want to let you know in the event they do appear on Tuesday.\n24 MR. DeMARCO: That makes perfect sense, your Honor.\n25 Our inclination, to be quite frank, was that if the defendants\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 38 Filed 07/14/15 Page 4 of 18 4\nF774ElsC\n1 did not appear, we were going to rest on our papers unless your\n2 Honor wanted to hear from witnesses. We put in some fairly\n3 detailed papers. We may have one or two additional\n4 declarations to put in. Unless your Honor was looking for live\n5 testimony, we were comfortable resting on our papers. That's\n6 our current thinking.\n7 THE COURT: I'm comfortable with that, as well. I\n8 will let you know if I have any particular issues that I want\n9 to hear live testimony on. Right now, I don't anticipate that\n10 if defendants don't appear. So I'm fine with that. I will\n11 give you the opportunity to be heard and make arguments if you\n12 would like to do that, but I will, obviously, have read all of\n13 the papers and be familiar with everything that you have\n14 submitted.\n15 As to the issue raised in the brief submitted by the\n16 amici, are you now seeking the same order but just with\n17 paragraphs 1, 3, 4, and 5?\n18 MR. DeMARCO: I have it in front of me now, your\n19 Honor, and we are comfortable excising 2 and 6. That would\n20 leave 1, 3, 4, and 5.\n21 THE COURT: Right. Okay.\n22 MR. DeMARCO: And 7.\n23 THE COURT: Yes. You're correct. Okay. Right. I\n24 think that is it. I really just wanted to touch base. This\n25 is, obviously, more important to do if we have parties\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 38 Filed 07/14/15 Page 5 of 18 5\nF774ElsC\n1 appearing on both sides so that we can talk about logistics, we\n2 can talk about any discovery that needs to occur prior to the\n3 hearing and talk about my procedures, but it seems like it is\n4 just going to be us, but I will see you on Tuesday.\n5 MR. DeMARCO: That makes perfect sense. Thank you\n6 very much, your Honor.\n7 Of course, if we hear or get any indication that the\n8 defendant might appear, we will, of course, let the Court know.\n9 If I could just ask the Court and its staff, if they hear the\n10 same, we may not here, if you could let us know. That way\n11 we're prepared in the event that we do need to call witnesses.\n12 THE COURT: Yes. If I hear anything, I will put\n13 something on the docket to that effect.\n14 As I said at the start, I have a transcript of today's\n15 telephone conference, so you should reach out to the court\n16 reporter if you're in need of the transcript. Otherwise, we\n17 will see you on Tuesday.\n18 MR. DeMARCO: Thank you very much.\n19 I did want to clarify one small point, your Honor. If\n20 I can ask one question for guidance as between you and Judge\n21 Sweet. We have every reason to believe, based upon\n22 Ms. Elbakyan's comments and otherwise that she, in fact, has\n23 received full notice of everything that has transpired to date.\n24 I did want to point out to the Court that with respect to the\n25 Sci-Hub site defendants, we did get some bounce-backs on the\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 38 Filed 07/14/15 Page 6 of 18 6\nF774ElsC\n1 email addresses for them. I don't believe that is a material\n2 problem insofar as Ms. Elbakyan has taken responsibility for\n3 that site. I also wanted to point out that the postal service\n4 is having trouble delivering the hard copy to the address in\n5 Kazakhstan. Again, in light of what I think is abundantly\n6 clear, that she has received notice, I don't think that is a\n7 material problem, as well, but I just did want to point that\n8 out to you.\n9 THE COURT: Thank you for making that record clear.\n10 All right. I think that's it. I will see you on\n11 Tuesday.\n12 MR. DeMARCO: One quick guidance question. We were\n13 anticipating filing a motion for permission to serve discovery\n14 on third parties in advance of the Rule 26 conference. Is that\n15 a motion properly addressed to Judge Sweet's chambers or to\n16 your Honor? It's purely on the papers.\n17 THE COURT: I think you should make that to Judge\n18 Sweet. I'm sorry. I don't mean to make this difficult for\n19 you. I will reach out to his chambers, though, so that they\n20 know that they should feel free to send it to me, but I just\n21 want to be very careful because I'm not yet on Part 1, and it\n22 is really up to him and his chambers to decide what to send to\n23 the Part 1 judge. As a result, in the first instance, it\n24 should go to him, but it may well come back to me, and I'm\n25 happy to deal with it at that point.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

DeMARCO: Yes, your Honor.\n13 THE COURT: Ms. Elbakyan, I'm a judge here in the\n14 Southern District of New York. I'm not the judge who is\n15 assigned to this case. That is Judge Sweet. But he scheduled\n16 a hearing for July 21st on this case. And to the extent that\n17 the hearing goes forward on that date, I will be handling the\n18 hearing.\n19 I'm not going to talk about anything substantive on\n20 the merits on this call. I just wanted to talk about the\n21 procedure and make sure that everyone does what needs to be\n22 done in advance of the July 21st hearing. Okay?\n23 MS. ELBAKYAN: Okay.\n24 THE COURT: So you have not yet appeared in this\n25 action. You have not had a lawyer file a notice of appearance\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

You're going to have to figure\n11 it out because we have a hearing scheduled a week from Tuesday,\n12 and your deadline has already passed for you to submit any\n13 responsive papers.\n14 Did you receive all of the papers, all of the legal\n15 briefs and the papers submitted by the plaintiff?\n16 MS. ELBAKYAN: Yes. I received but can I submit a\n17 reply?\n18 THE COURT: You can submit it to the Court. I will\n19 grant you a short extension to do that, to respond on the\n20 papers. I will give you until Monday to do that, so that will\n21 be July 13th. So, by Monday, you need to submit the papers\n22 here to the Court in response --\n23 MS. ELBAKYAN: Yes.

So we have\n4 a court website. It is the website for the United States\n5 District Court for the Southern District of New York. If you\n6 go on it, there is a section on the pro se unit, and you'll\n7 file all your documents with them, and they will file it with\n8 the Court. You can reach out to them.

I can send by phone, yes?\n16 THE COURT: No. You can call the Pro Se Office, but\n17 we have a hearing scheduled for the 21st, and there are going\n18 to be witnesses at the hearing, and someone is going to have to\n19 come represent you and the hearing. If you want to represent\n20 yourself, you can do that, but you will have to come in person.\n21 MS. ELBAKYAN: Yes.

ELBAKYAN: No, I don't run the website.\n12 THE COURT: And what about Libgen.org?\n13 MS. ELBAKYAN: That's the same.\n14 THE COURT: That's the same. I know, it's just\n15 Libgen.org is the name under which the Library Genesis Project\n16 does business. Is that right?\n17 MS. ELBAKYAN: No. There is no business. This is a\n18 totally noncommercial website. They provide all for free.\n19 THE COURT: Who runs Libgen.org or The Library Genesis\n20 Project? Do you?\n21 MS. ELBAKYAN: No. No.\n22 THE COURT: I'm asking these questions because a\n23 corporation, a corporate entity, something other than a person,\n24 cannot represent itself in court in the United States in a\n25 federal court. It needs to be represented by an attorney. A\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

Do you intend to try and\n3 get an attorney?\n4 MS. ELBAKYAN: But I cannot. No money to hire an\n5 attorney. We don't have money to hire an attorney.\n6 Hello?\n7 THE COURT: Yes. Mr. DeMarco, let me ask you a\n8 question.\n9 MR. DeMARCO: Yes, your Honor.\n10 THE COURT: Do you intend to seek discovery prior to\n11 this hearing?\n12 MR. DeMARCO: So we're still determining that, your\n13 Honor; but at this stage, the only discovery we were going to\n14 be seeking would be against third parties. We will have to\n15 think that over in light of the fact that we have one party on\n16 the line. I think we need to think about that, your Honor. I\n17 have not given that any thought, to be perfectly honest with\n18 you.\n19 THE COURT: What I would like you to do is think about\n20 that, and then if you can write a letter to Judge Sweet and to\n21 me and let me know if you intend to seek discovery. I'm trying\n22 to figure out if the hearing is going to be put off, if there\n23 is a need for that, particularly if Ms. Elbakyan wants to\n24 submit a response by Monday. I don't know if you will want to\n25 reply to that or if there will be a need to have discovery in\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

I\n3 understand this is new for you, this development, and you may\n4 need to think about next steps.\n5 MR. DeMARCO: Thank you, your Honor.\n6 In the event we are not going to be seeking discovery\n7 in advance of the hearing from the defendant on the line, would\n8 your Honor be inclined to have us go forward on the 21st?\n9 THE COURT: I think so. I think we're going to need\n10 to think about the logistics. I don't know if Ms. Elbakyan is\n11 going to try to get an attorney.\n12 Ms. Elbakyan, some attorneys are willing to represent\n13 people for free. They are called pro bono attorneys. I don't\n14 know if you'll be able to obtain a pro bono attorney to\n15 represent you in this action. I don't know if you intend to\n16 try to get an attorney. As I said, today I am not deciding the\n17 merits of the action; I'm just trying to set a schedule and\n18 deal with the logistics of how we're going to proceed.\n19 MS. ELBAKYAN: I want to submit a reply to this. Can\n20 I submit by email?\n21 THE COURT: What you need to do is call the Pro Se\n22 Office here in the Court, and I will get you that phone number,\n23 and you can call them, and they will help you with the\n24 logistics of how to file your reply, your opposition, as we\n25 call it. Okay?\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 38 Filed 07/14/15 Page 13 of 18 13\nF774ElsC\n1 MS. ELBAKYAN: Okay.\n2 THE COURT: Give me one second.

ELBAKYAN: Okay. 212-805-0175.\n9 THE COURT: Right.\n10 And there's a website, this is The United States\n11 District Court for the Southern District of New York, and it is\n12 in the Pro Se Office of that court. So if you go to the court\n13 website and look for the Pro Se Office, it explains what its\n14 role is and how it accepts papers submitted by people who don't\n15 have lawyers, by pro se litigants.\n16 MR. DeMARCO: Your Honor, may I make a suggestion?\n17 THE COURT: Go ahead, Mr. DeMarco.\n18 MR. DeMARCO: Maybe it makes sense for us to schedule,\n19 while we have everyone on the line, another call a week from\n20 today, at 4:30. By that time, we should have any papers that\n21 the defendant has submitted, and the defendant will have had\n22 time to determine whether or not she is going to come to the\n23 hearing and represent herself at the hearing or get an\n24 attorney, and I think it might be beneficial for the efficiency\n25 of the following Tuesday if we just had another brief call like\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 38 Filed 07/14/15 Page 14 of 18 14\nF774ElsC\n1 today.\n2 THE COURT: That's fine. What time did you suggest?\n3 MR. DeMARCO: At the Court's discretion, of course.\n4 THE COURT: No, no. It's fine. What did you suggest?\n5 MR. DeMARCO: 4:00.\n6 THE COURT: So why don't we have another conference\n7 call at 4:00 on the 13th.\n8 MS. ELBAKYAN: 13th.\n9 THE COURT: Yes.\n10 Sorry. You said a week from today. So on the 14th.\n11 On the 14th, a week from today, on July 14th, at 4:00, we will\n12 have another conference call.\n13 Again, the goal here is to just talk about how we're\n14 going to go about doing things, about logistics, and to see if\n15 there is a need to put off the hearing or if the hearing will\n16 take place on the 21st. Okay?\n17 MR. DeMARCO: Your Honor, if we did put it off, would\n18 your Honor retain the case?\n19 THE COURT: I don't know. I would have to talk to\n20 other judges, see when it would be scheduled for and the like\n21 because, as you know, it is Judge Sweet's case. I don't know\n22 the answer to that.\n23 MR. DeMARCO: The papers are a little voluminous, and\n24 I feel bad making more than one judge read them.\n25 THE COURT: I understand. It depends. If, for\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

If is there a need for this to move, for\n4 example, to later in July or August or even September, when\n5 Judge Sweet is back, then I think that would change. So the\n6 more information you can provide me on that, the sooner the\n7 better.\n8 MR. DeMARCO: Understood.\n9 THE COURT: All right. So Ms. Elbakyan, you are going\n10 to submit what we call an opposition, a response to the papers\n11 submitted by the plaintiff, by Elsevier. You are going to call\n12 the Pro Se Office and talk about how you will get those papers\n13 filed. They're due on Monday, the 13th. But you can speak to\n14 plaintiff's counsel. Perhaps, for efficiency, you can email\n15 the opposition to plaintiffs.\n16 Do you have a problem with that, Mr. DeMarco?\n17 MR. DeMARCO: I just as soon get them through the\n18 pro se clerk or ECF, your Honor.\n19 THE COURT: It sometimes takes longer, which is why I\n20 was suggesting that, but that is up to you.\n21 What is your email, Ms. Elbakyan?\n22 MS. ELBAKYAN: My email?\n23 THE COURT: If there is a reason that the Court needs\n24 to get in touch with you, do you want to provide me with your\n25 email or your contact information?\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 38 Filed 07/14/15 Page 16 of 18 16\nF774ElsC\n1 MS. ELBAKYAN: Yes. Email can be found online, so you\n2 can Google it.\n3 THE COURT: I assume it is one of emails at which you\n4 were served in this case. So it is mindwrapper@Gmail.com?\n5 MS. ELBAKYAN: Yes. That's correct.\n6 THE COURT: We want to be able to get in touch with\n7 you. If you don't defend in an action, if you don't respond on\n8 time and follow the orders of the Court, then you may be held\n9 in default. I just want to make sure that you are aware of\n10 everything going forward. You may want to look into trying to\n11 get an attorney to represent you in this action, because again\n12 someone needs to represent you at the time of the hearing.\n13 So Mr. DeMarco, other than the call a week from today,\n14 on Tuesday, the 4th, do you want to write the Court in advance?\n15 You're free to do that. We can leave it to the Tuesday call,\n16 but if you have any other suggestions for how to proceed, if\n17 you want to talk to Ms. Elbakyan, for example, it may be that\n18 you're able the coordinate about next steps and submit a letter\n19 both to Judge Sweet and to me just proposing next steps in this\n20 case.\n21 MR. DeMARCO: I think, at the minimum, your Honor, we\n22 will get back to you very quickly on the question of whether or\n23 not we're going to be seeking discovery, which I think will or\n24 won't have an effect on the scheduling in the event that we are\n25 or are not. We will know that very shortly. As soon as I know\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

And if we have any other thoughts or\n4 suggestions -- my understanding again from your Honor's rules\n5 is that with respect to even hearings where parties attend,\n6 direct is typically by affidavit with cross of the witnesses\n7 live.\n8 THE COURT: That's correct, unless there is a\n9 particular application to have a witness testify live.\n10 MR. DeMARCO: Obviously, I have to go back and talk to\n11 my client about today's developments, but it may very well be\n12 that we still are going to proceed purely on our papers for\n13 purposes of direct. We will know more once we see any\n14 opposition papers submitted.\n15 THE COURT: So Ms. Elbakyan, you're going to submit an\n16 opposition. You're going to call in again a week from today at\n17 4:00. I'm going to draft an order to this effect that\n18 plaintiffs will serve on you, and you will call the Pro Se\n19 Office if you have questions about the procedure of how to file\n20 things, and you will try and get an attorney who may be able to\n21 represent you, if you so choose.\n22 MS. ELBAKYAN: Okay.\n23 THE COURT: Remember that corporations cannot\n24 represent themselves. You can represent yourself, but they\n25 need to have a lawyer represent them. Okay? Do you understand\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 38 Filed 07/14/15 Page 18 of 18 18\nF774ElsC\n1 that?\n2 MS. ELBAKYAN: Yes. Can I represent myself in this\n3 case?\n4 THE COURT: You can represent yourself individually,\n5 but as to any corporate entity, it needs to be represented by\n6 an attorney.\n7 MS.

Sci-Huh, et al., 15-cv-4282 (R WS)\nDear Judge Sweet:\nWe represent Elsevier Inc, Elsevier 13.V .. and Elsevier Ltd., the Plaintiffs in the\nabove-referenced matter, which was filed on June 3, 2015. Plaintiffs intend to file an\nApplication for an Order Authorizing Alternative Service of Process and Motion for a\nPreliminary Injunction and Order Transfe1Ting Domain Names. Following a conversation with\nYour Honor's Chambers. we respectfully request that the Court (I) permit Plaintiffs to seal\ncertain information contained in a single declaration exhibit to Plaintiffs memorandum of law.\nand (2) grant Plaintiffs a I 0-page extension on the Court's 25-page limit for its memorandum of\nlaw.\nRequest to Seal Certain Confidential Information\nPlaintiffs intend to file. with their memorandum of law, a declaration from\nAnthony Woltermann, a Technology Infrastructure and Operations Manager at Elsevier Inc. (the\n'·Woltermann Declaration''). The Woltennann Declaration will discuss Plantiff s platform for\nstoring its copyrighted works, entitled \"ScienceDirect,'' and will specifically describe both the\nstructural features of ScienceDirect' s authentication mechanism and the manner in which this\nmechanism operates. While it is important that this information be presented to the Court, since\nPlaintiffs allege that it is this system that Defendants are, in fact, exploiting, the authentication\nmechanism is highly confidential and sensitive information that is not generally available to the\npublic. If this information were to be disclosed publicly, it could be used by malicious actors to\nunlawfully gain access to Plaintiffs ScienceDirect platform.\nrC:l ,-f\n'61119'J 12'\"~-'7\nPark :\\n:nuc,Suitc: 11110 :\\cw York. :\\cwY11rk 11•1111, Tckplv1nc: 212.:122.'1·-\\'!J'l-.ix_;,2_\nwww.dcvorcdcmarco.com # ~- - c~'\n{? _.)_ /\n(' _ --- 2 CJ·-c.0 I\n' t'- J).\n/,J\"'\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 4 Filed 06/09/15 Page 2 of 3\nAs this Court is aware, the presumption of public access to judicial documents is\nsubject to multiple exceptions designed to protect confidential and sensitive information\n(Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. ofO nondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 119-20 (2d Cir. 2006)), and the court may,\nfor good cause shown, issue an order to protect any party including \"requiring that a trade secret\nor other confidential research, development, or commercial information not be revealed or be\nrevealed only in a specified way.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)(l)(G). The presumption of public\naccess, which arises out of the First Amendment, may be overcome \"to preserve higher values\"\nprovided \"the sealing order is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.\" Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 120\n(quoting In re New York Times Co., 828 F.2d 110, 116 (2d Cir. 1987).\nPlaintiffs clearly meet this burden. Plaintiffs' request here relates to precisely the\ntype of confidential information that has been found to justify sealing in this Circuit, an in this\nCourt in particular. See Standard Inv. Chartered, Inc. v. Fin. Indus. Regulatory Auth., No. 08-\n4922, 2009 WL 2778447, at **2 (2d Cir. 2009) (organization's '\"interest in protecting\nconfidential business information outweighs the qualified First Amendment presumption of\npublic access.\"'); GoSMiLE, Inc. v. Dr. Jonathan Levine, D.M.D. P.C., 769 F. Supp. 2d 630,\n649-50 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (granting motion to seal \"highly proprietary material concerning ...\nmarketing strategies, product development, costs and budgeting.\"); Sherwin-Williams Co. v.\nSpitzer, No. 04-185, 2005 WL 2128938 (N.D.N.Y. Aug. 24, 2005) (ordering the sealing of\ndocuments ... regarding confidential information such as trade secrets, and commercial and\nproprietary interests); Gelb v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 813 F. Supp. 1022, 1035 (S.D.N.Y. 1993)\n(granting motion to seal documents based upon the \"assertion that its competitors who do not\nnow have this information could use it to do (the party] competitive injury .... \"). Moreover,\nPlaintiffs' request is narrow - it necessitates sealing only two paragraphs of one declaration over\n60 paragraphs in length.\nFor these reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that they be permitted to file\ncertain information in the Woltermann Declaration under seal.\nRequest For a Page Limit Extension\nPlaintiffs intend to file applications with the Court for (I) an order authorizing\nalternative service of process; (2) an order to show cause for a preliminary injunction, and (3) an\norder to transfer certain domain names controlled by Defendants. The facts germane to all three\nrequests are inextricably intertwined and significantly overlap. Accordingly, in the interest of\nefficiency, rather than file three separate applications, with three associated memoranda of law,\nPlaintiffs propose to file one Application and one omnibus Memorandum of Law. This will\ngreatly reduce the burden on the Court in having to deal with three separate motions and their\nassociated briefings. In order to accomplish this while still being able to make all of the\nnecessary arguments and present all of the relevant facts, Plaintiffs respectfully request that they\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 4 Filed 06/09/15 Page 3 of 3\nbe permitted to exceed the 25-page limit for this omnibus Memorandum by approximately ten\npages, for a total of approximately 35 pages.\nThank you in advance for your consideration of this request.\nRespectfully submitted,\n9\n~/vf'.~\nJoseph V.

DEMARCO: Good afternoon, your Honor.\n4 THE COURT: Good afternoon. So, Mr. DeMarco, I have\n5 you and your colleagues on the line.\n6 And, Ms. Elbakyan, are you there as well?\n7 MS. ELBAKYAN: Yes.\n8 THE COURT: Okay. Good afternoon.\n9 So, Ms. Elbakyan, last time we spoke you indicated\n10 that you were going to file an opposition to the plaintiff's\n11 complaint and motion for preliminary injunction. I never\n12 received anything. But I did separately issue an order asking\n13 you if you would like the Court to attempt to locate you pro\n14 bono counsel, which means an attorney who might be willing to\n15 represent you free of charge.\n16 Is that something that you're interested in?\n17 MS. ELBAKYAN: No, but I have additional question. I\n18 spoke to pro se and they told me they don't accept anything by\n19 email. They only accept by mail.\n20 THE COURT: That may be. Look, it's completely up to\n21 you whether you get an attorney. I look at this case and I\n22 think that there are a lot of complicated or potentially\n23 complicated legal issues regarding jurisdiction or what\n24 extraterritorial relief could be ordered and a number of sort\n25 of issues that are complicated under U.S. law.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 42 Filed 07/27/15 Page 3 of 11 3\nF7ELELSC TELEPHONE CONFERENCE\n1 I don't know if a lawyer would be willing to represent\n2 you, but one might be willing to do that and that person could\n3 handle all the filings, so, to the extent you're having trouble\n4 filing things. But if you're not interested, that's fine.\n5 It's really up to you.\n6 MS. ELBAKYAN: But I want additional time to find a\n7 lawyer because, for example --\n8 THE COURT: I'm sorry, could you repeat that, please?\n9 MS. ELBAKYAN: I need additional time to find a\n10 lawyer.\n11 THE COURT: Okay.\n12 MS. ELBAKYAN: Could you delay the hearing until\n13 August 21.\n14 THE COURT: August 21, is that what you asked for?\n15 MS. ELBAKYAN: Yes.\n16 THE COURT: Okay. Mr. DeMarco.\n17 MR. DEMARCO: So, obviously, your Honor, if the\n18 defendant plans on finding an attorney to represent her in\n19 court by filing a notice of appearance, i.e., an attorney\n20 admitted before the court and plans to retain counsel in order\n21 to litigate the matter, then obviously, you know, we consent to\n22 that.\n23 I am concerned, though, that we're going to come back\n24 either on the 21st or the week before for a prehearing\n25 conference and the defendant will not have secured a lawyer. I\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 42 Filed 07/27/15 Page 4 of 11 4\nF7ELELSC TELEPHONE CONFERENCE\n1 think your Honor has given the defendants ample time to respond\n2 and, you know, we don't have any opposition papers yet. But\n3 obviously if the defendant wants more time to find an attorney,\n4 we will consent to that limited extension. But I think we\n5 would request that there be no additional extensions on that\n6 basis at that time.\n7 THE COURT: I understand. Let me ask you this,\n8 Mr. DeMarco. I know you had previously expressed a concern\n9 about having this jump from judge to judge, which frankly I\n10 understand. Judge Sweet is back, as I understand it, in\n11 mid-September. Is it your preference, if I were to grant this\n12 request for an adjournment until August 21 for Ms. Elbakyan to\n13 attempt to secure an attorney, would your preference be to\n14 proceed on August 21 or for me to speak to Judge Sweet's\n15 chambers and schedule it a day after he has returned and,\n16 therefore, one judge will be handling it; do you have a\n17 preference in that respect?\n18 MR. DEMARCO: I think our only preference is that it\n19 not preambulate to yet another judge. We're indifferent as\n20 between your Honor and Judge Sweet. I think you both have now\n21 read the papers. We have a slight preference for proceeding on\n22 the 21st if your Honor is available. But as between proceeding\n23 with a third judge on the 21st versus waiting for Judge Sweet\n24 in early September, I think we'd be fine waiting until early\n25 September.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 42 Filed 07/27/15 Page 5 of 11 5\nF7ELELSC TELEPHONE CONFERENCE\n1 That may not answer your question or help you, but I\n2 think that's what our thinking is.\n3 THE COURT: It does. I'm unavailable on August 21.\n4 So I think if the hearing were scheduled then, it would be\n5 before the Part I judge then. And I apologize for this; I know\n6 that can be frustrating. And that's why I asked you because\n7 I'm trying to be fair and take into consideration the need from\n8 your client's perspective to move as quickly as possible, but I\n9 also want to balance that against the inconvenience and the\n10 difficulty that you may face if a number of different judges\n11 are involved.\n12 MR. DEMARCO: I think if we're talking between the\n13 21st and another judge versus September and Judge Sweet, we\n14 would prefer September and Judge Sweet.\n15 THE COURT: Okay. So what I'm going to do is I'm\n16 going to call his chambers and schedule it, once I speak to\n17 them, as soon as he's available to do it in September.\n18 Ms. Elbakyan, I just want to make sure you understand\n19 this. I am on what we call Part I. It essentially means that\n20 I'm the emergency judge for a few weeks. And the judge whose\n21 case this is, to whom this case is assigned, is a judge by the\n22 name of Judge Sweet and he is back in September.\n23 And so what I think I'm going to do is I'm going to\n24 grant your request for additional time to submit an opposition\n25 and to attempt to get an attorney. But I'm going to talk to\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 42 Filed 07/27/15 Page 6 of 11 6\nF7ELELSC TELEPHONE CONFERENCE\n1 his chambers, his office, before I schedule a final date for\n2 the hearing. But I expect right now that that date, it will be\n3 after the August 21 date you asked for. It will either be\n4 August 21 or, if he'll be back in early September or\n5 mid-September, I'll schedule it in mid-September before Judge\n6 Sweet.\n7 Do you understand that?\n8 MS. ELBAKYAN: September is good.\n9 THE COURT: Okay. So that's what I'm going to do.\n10 But I will tell you, Ms. Elbakyan, you have to move quickly\n11 both in attempting to retain an attorney and you'll have to\n12 stick to the schedule that is set once it's set. So I am going\n13 to give you additional time to attempt to obtain an attorney\n14 and to file your opposition and, presumably, your attorney will\n15 file that for you. But you will have to stick to those dates.\n16 So you will not be permitted in September to ask for additional\n17 time, okay, because we're giving you over approximately two\n18 months. So you need to work fast and be prepared to have a\n19 hearing in September. Do you understand that?\n20 MS. ELBAKYAN: Yes, I understand.\n21 THE COURT: Okay.\n22 MR. DEMARCO: Your Honor, just a couple of things.\n23 First is perhaps your Honor could set some of those dates,\n24 i.e., a date by which the defendant must retain an attorney and\n25 file any papers either through that attorney or, if she's not\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 42 Filed 07/27/15 Page 7 of 11 7\nF7ELELSC TELEPHONE CONFERENCE\n1 going to be represented, she can't find an attorney, through\n2 the pro se office by mailing them to the pro se office well in\n3 advance of that date.\n4 And then the second thing was another thought occurred\n5 to me, your Honor, which is that since we're dealing here with\n6 just one of multiple defendants and remaining defendants have\n7 not appeared and are in default, one other option to keep the\n8 matter moving forward potentially would be for us to appear\n9 before your Honor on Tuesday only with respect to the other\n10 defendants and presumably move on our papers at that time if\n11 your Honor is amenable.\n12 THE COURT: I think it's best to have it all happen at\n13 one hearing and it should I think happen before Judge Sweet in\n14 light of our prior discussion and the reason is that based on\n15 my recollection of the last call, Ms. Elbakyan has admitted her\n16 involvement in at least some of the corporate defendants and,\n17 therefore, it may be that when she gets an attorney, that\n18 attorney represents one or more of the corporate entities as\n19 well as her individually.\n20 And so just so we're not in a situation where we have\n21 a motion for default and then perhaps a motion to vacate that,\n22 I think it's best to give her time and a specific amount of\n23 time to attempt to obtain an attorney and then to move forward\n24 with the hearing at once. But I understand why you asked, but\n25 I think that's best.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 42 Filed 07/27/15 Page 8 of 11 8\nF7ELELSC TELEPHONE CONFERENCE\n1 Ms. Elbakyan, I just want to make something clear to\n2 you which is that you need to have an attorney who's able to\n3 represent you here in New York. Do you understand that?\n4 MS. ELBAKYAN: Yes.\n5 THE COURT: Okay. So it needs to be someone who is\n6 admitted to the bar here or is working with someone who can get\n7 them temporarily admitted or, as we call it, pro hac vice here\n8 in New York. If you want the Court to attempt to locate an\n9 attorney for you, you'll have to tell me within the next week.\n10 Otherwise, I assume that you will try to get an attorney. And\n11 what I'm going to do -- how much time do you think it will take\n12 you to do that? Because, again, I want to set firm dates so\n13 that this doesn't continually get pushed off. How much time do\n14 you think you'll need to get an attorney?\n15 MS. ELBAKYAN: I think I need at least one month or\n16 more.\n17 THE COURT: Okay. I'm going to give you until that\n18 August 21 date to get an attorney to file a notice of\n19 appearance, okay. And then I'm going to give you one week\n20 after that to have your attorney file an opposition to the\n21 plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction. Okay?\n22 MS. ELBAKYAN: Okay.\n23 THE COURT: And then I am going to give the plaintiffs\n24 one week to reply to that. So that's September 4, all right.\n25 So you have until August 21 to obtain an attorney. The sooner\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 42 Filed 07/27/15 Page 9 of 11 9\nF7ELELSC TELEPHONE CONFERENCE\n1 you do it, the better because then that attorney will have more\n2 time to get up to speed on your case and submit an opposition.\n3 Okay?\n4 MS. ELBAKYAN: Okay.\n5 THE COURT: And then the plaintiffs will have until\n6 August 28 to reply. Excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm going to say\n7 that again because I don't think I was very clear.\n8 So you'll have until August 21 to get an attorney file\n9 a notice of appearance. You'll have until August 28 to submit\n10 an opposition. And plaintiffs will have until September 4 to\n11 submit a reply. And then I will talk to Judge Sweet's chambers\n12 and schedule a date for the hearing in September. I expect\n13 that it will be the week of September 14, but I'm going to\n14 confirm that with him. Okay?\n15 MS. ELBAKYAN: Okay.\n16 THE COURT: But if you want the Court to get you an\n17 attorney, you need to do that one week from today, okay, you\n18 just need to tell us that you want us to do that. Otherwise,\n19 we're going to leave it to you to get your own attorney. Do\n20 you understand that?\n21 MS. ELBAKYAN: Yes.\n22 THE COURT: Okay. So what I'm going to do is I'm\n23 going to, after I speak to Judge Sweet's chambers, I'm going to\n24 issue an order with these dates in it and I'm going to put it\n25 what we call on the docket and the plaintiffs will serve it on\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 42 Filed 07/27/15 Page 10 of 11 10\nF7ELELSC TELEPHONE CONFERENCE\n1 you and then we'll proceed with this schedule and you will be\n2 before another judge in September.\n3 MS. ELBAKYAN: Okay.\n4 THE COURT: Mr. DeMarco, do you have any other\n5 thoughts or applications at this time?\n6 MR. DEMARCO: Just two thoughts, your Honor. The\n7 first is I think a week will be enough time to file any reply\n8 papers to any opposition papers, but obviously if we could with\n9 the Court's permission ask for more time in the event that the\n10 papers that oppose our application are voluminous. But,\n11 obviously, we can take that up with Judge Sweet.\n12 THE COURT: That's fine. Frankly, right now as I've\n13 scheduled it, there are at least ten days between the\n14 opposition papers and the hearing. So I mean so I can give you\n15 a little more time now. Would it help to have until that\n16 Wednesday the 9th?\n17 MR. DEMARCO: Sure.\n18 THE COURT: Okay.\n19 MR. DEMARCO: And then secondarily, in the event that\n20 the defendant on the phone would like the Court's help in\n21 finding an attorney, perhaps your Honor could just spell out\n22 what exactly is required of the defendant in order for her to\n23 do that. I think your Honor mentioned that in the prior order\n24 which was served on the defendant, but it may be worth going\n25 over that just so we don't have to all get on the phone again.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 42 Filed 07/27/15 Page 11 of 11 11\nF7ELELSC TELEPHONE CONFERENCE\n1 THE COURT: That's fine. I'll put information in the\n2 order that I hope will be helpful to her.\n3 So, again, Ms. Elbakyan, do you have any questions?\n4 MS. ELBAKYAN: No.\n5 THE COURT: Okay. Again, I urge you to try and get an\n6 attorney as soon as possible and submit your opposition as soon\n7 as possible. But, in any event, if you want the Court to\n8 assist you in getting an attorney, you've got to tell me a week\n9 from today.\n10 MS. ELBAKYAN: Okay.\n11 THE COURT: Are you still getting emails at the same\n12 address?\n13 MS. ELBAKYAN: Yes, I still get emails.\n14 THE COURT: At the same email address. Okay. I just\n15 wanted to confirm that so that we're able to contact you. All\n16 right. I think that's it from my perspective, unless anyone\n17 has any other applications or questions.\n18 MR. DEMARCO: We do not, your Honor.\n19 THE COURT: Okay. Thank you both. Thank you all.\n20 MR. DEMARCO: Thank you, your Honor.\n21 THE COURT: We're adjourned. If you'd like a copy of\n22 this transcript, you can reach out to the court reporters,\n23 okay. You can go on the website SDreporters.com.

Examples are provided on our access pages:\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/books-and-journals/access\n1\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 46 Filed 08/19/15 Page 2 of 3\n4. Elsevier also provides specific low-cost -- or even free -- access options to its\npublications in developing countries. This includes programs such as Research4Life, the ICTP\ne-journals delivery service, the Library of Alexandra, TEEAL, and a wide array of open access\npublications. Each of these programs is described on our website:\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/books-and-journals/access#Developing. In the next paragraph we\nprovide more detailed information about Research4Life in particular as our flagship initiative for\ndeveloping countries.\n3. Research4Life is a public-private partnership between United Nations agencies,\nuniversities and publishers to reduce the knowledge gap between developing and industrialized\ncountries.1 As a founding partner, Elsevier contributes over a quarter of the nearly 50,000 peer\nreviewed resources in Research4Life, encompassing our ScienceDirect and Scopus database\nproducts, including over 3,100 Elsevier journals and 13,000 books. We also provide technical\nand communications expertise to advance Research4Life, and have committed to the program\nthrough 2020. In 2014, there were over 3.9 million authorized Research4Life article downloads\nfrom Elsevier’s ScienceDirect platform -- the platform that the Defendants have illegally\naccessed as part of their piracy scheme.\n4. Elsevier also participates in the International Centre Theoretical Physics (ICTP)\neJournals Delivery Service,2 which provides individual scientists in developing countries working\nin the fields of physics, mathematics and computer science with free access to scientific literature in\ntheir disciplines, including approximately 430 Elsevier journals.\n1 See Research4Life website, available at http://www.research4life.org.\n2 See International Centre Theoretical Physics (ICTP) eJournals Delivery Service website, available at\nhttp://ejds.ictp.it/ejds.\n2\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 46 Filed 08/19/15 Page 3 of 3",

Now on the home page it will say what the project is, and what we are fighting for.\nWe’re still finalizing development of the design, and it is now accessible to all Russian-language users. Why was\nthis necessary? First, it became clear after communicating with the group that many people have a very vague\nunderstanding of the goals and objectives of the Sci-Hub project. For example, many think that we are fighting for\nsome kind of “freedom of information.”\nIn reality, “freedom of information” is a very broad and ambiguous topic. It includes such issues as the freedom to\npublish insults, slander, political propaganda, or pornographic material. The freedom to distribute academic\nknowledge is only part of this matter (and far from the most important part) in comparison with all the other issues.\nThe fight against political censorship on the Internet has become the foremost issue.\nIn contrast, Sci-Hub is fighting mainly for the free, unrestricted, and large-scale distribution specifically of\nknowledge and academic/educational information and is not engaged in other issues.\nI hope this will clear up any confusion.\nSecondly, the project has already been operating for four years now, and through our efforts a great number of\nacademic articles have been uploaded and placed in the library. What’s important now is to make the work of the\nlibrary absolutely legal at the legislative level. We will continue to upload articles, even though most are already\nuploaded, and now we need to ensure their legalization.\nAlexandra Elbakyan\nJul 13, 2015, at 9:23 a.m. | Like 73",

Sweet\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nDaniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse\n500 Pearl St.\nNew York, New York 10007-1312\nRe: Elsevier, Inc., et al. v. Sci-Hub, et al., 15-cv-4282 (RWS)\nDear Judge Sweet,\nAs the Court is aware, we are counsel to Elsevier Inc., Elsevier B.V., and Elsevier\nLtd. (“Elsevier”) in the above-captioned action. Following a telephone conference with your\nChambers on August 18, 2015, we write in relation to the upcoming Motion Hearing, scheduled\nfor September 16, 2015. In particular, we write (1) to advise the Court of certain facts relevant\nto our request for injunctive relief which have come to light since our initial filings in this matter,\nand (2) to clarify certain aspects of the Motion for Preliminary Injunction we previously filed on\nJune 9, 2015 (Dkt. 5) in accordance with proceedings subsequent to that date.1\nAs a threshold matter, and as described more fully below, through her online\npostings in recent weeks, Defendant Elbakyan has admitted that she is the operator of Sci-Hub\nand that she distributes Elsevier’s works for free through Sci-Hub.2 Moreover, since Elsevier’s\ninitiation of this action, Elbakyan and other Defendants have both expanded the scope of their\ninfringing activities and sought to frustrate the efficacy of Elsevier’s requested relief. These\nefforts have firmly demonstrated Defendants’ intention to continue to willfully infringe\nElseviers’ copyrights – and to do so on a massive scale.\nFor example, as more fully described in the Supplemental Declaration of Anthony\nWoltermann, filed August 19, 2015 (Dkt. 47) (“Woltermann Decl.”), Defendants have registered\na number of additional domain names through which they distribute pirated Elsevier content.\n1 As the Court is aware, during the month of July, this matter was assigned to the Honorable\nRonnie Abrams, United States District Judge, sitting in Part I. While before Judge Abrams and with\nCourt Reporters present, telephonic conferences were held on July 7 and July 14, 2015. Plaintiffs assume\nthe Court’s familiarity with those conferences, but are available to answer any questions about them\nshould the Court desire.\n2 See Woltermann Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. A,\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 48 Filed 08/19/15 Page 2 of 3\nSpecifically, defendant Elbakyan has registered the domain Sci-Hub.club, which provides an\nalternative means of access to Sci-Hub’s unlawful services. (See Woltermann Decl. ¶¶ 6,7\n(noting that Sci-Hub.club and Sci-Hub.org reside at the same IP address)). Defendants have also\nregistered new domains at which users can access the Library Genesis Project archive, including\nappliedsciencefreelibraryguide.com. (Woltermann Decl. ¶¶ 9, 14). Since the initiation of the\ninstant suit, Defendants have also changed proxy domain registrants and/or server providers for\npreviously-identified sites.\n3\nThe establishment of these new distribution channels is plainly motivated by Defendants’\ndesire to infringe as many of Elsevier’s works as quickly and efficiently possible,\nnotwithstanding their clear knowledge that such activities are patently illegal. Indeed, in a\nmessage displayed to visitors to the Sci-Hub website, Elbakyan admitted that “[s]ince the project\nstarted in 2011, we have distributed tens of millions of research papers for free. And we work to\nincrease these numbers.” (Woltermann Decl. ¶ 5; see also id. at ¶ 2 (discussing efforts to upload\nas many pirated articles as possible as well as plans to hack Google Books)).\nDefendant Elbakyan has also renewed her solicitation of donations to support her\nillegal Sci-Hub scheme (Woltermann Decl. ¶¶ 5, 8). Perhaps recognizing the flatly illegal (and\nalmost certainly criminal) nature of her infringing conduct, Elbakyan has attempted to portray\nher motives as laudable. She has, for example, claimed that, by charging fees for access to its\nproprietary databases, Elsevier somehow provides only wealthy groups and individuals with\naccess to scientific literature -- and even knowledge itself. While not relevant to the claims in\nthis matter, it should nevertheless be pointed out that Elbakyan’s statements are patently false.\nAs described in the Supplemental Declaration of Paul F. Doda, filed August 19, 2015 (Dkt. 46)\n(“Doda Decl.”), Elsevier goes to great lengths to make scientific literature widely available,\nincluding at little or no cost to the developing world. These efforts include Elsevier’s\nparticipation in the Research4Life group, a public-private partnership between the United\nNations, universities, and publishers which seeks to reduce knowledge gaps between developing\nand industrialized countries. (Doda Decl. ¶ 3). Through this one project alone, Elsevier has\nprovided more than 3.9 million articles to users in low and middle-income nations. (Id.).\nElsevier also participates in the ICTP eJournals Delivery Service, which provides free physics,\nmathematics, and computer science journals to scientists in developing countries, and, through\ninterlibrary loan agreements in place at key national libraries, allows low-cost or free access to\nits journals. (Doda Decl. ¶¶ 4, 5).\nFinally, we request that the Court modify the proposed Order contained in our\nMotion for Preliminary Injunction to remove paragraphs 2 and 6, to clarify the relief plaintiffs\ncurrently seek in this matter, in accordance with prior hearings before Judge Abrams. See\nTranscript of July 7, 2014, telephonic conference at 4; see also Letter to Court dated July 6, 2015\n(Dkt. 34). If necessary to accomplish this “housekeeping,” we request that the Court permit\nPlaintiffs to file a revised Motion for Preliminary Injunction which omits service issues and\n3 See Woltermann Decl. ¶¶ 4, 13. So as to provide the Court with the most current information\nregarding the Defendants’ website hosting and registration, we have included up-to-date WHOIS\ninformation for previously-identified domains. (Woltermann Decl. ¶¶ 4, 10-13.)\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 48 Filed 08/19/15 Page 3 of 3",

Elsevier has also filed an\nApplication for an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be granted\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65, 17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq., 18.U.S.C. § 1030, the common law, and\nthe All Writs Act (28 U.S.C. § 1651).\nHaving reviewed the papers, declarations, exhibits, and memorandum filed in\nsupport of Plaintiff’s Application for an Order to Show Cause for Preliminary Injunction (the\n“Application”), the Court hereby finds:\n1. There is good cause to believe that Defendants have engaged in and are\nlikely to continue to engage in activities that violate the copyright laws of the United States (17\nU.S.C. § 101 et seq.) and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18.U.S.C. § 1030), and that\nElsevier is, therefore, likely to prevail on the merits of this action;\n1\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 48-1 Filed 08/19/15 Page 2 of 4\n2.

R. Civ. P. 4(f)(3).\nGood cause exists for the foregoing orders. As set forth in Elsevier’s\nmemorandum of law in support of this Application, Defendants are engaging in activities\nconstituting unlawful access to, use, reproduction, and distribution of Elsevier’s copyrighted\nworks. Defendants’ unlawful activities have caused and will continue to cause irreparable injury\nto Elsevier, its customers, and the public.

(collectively “Elsevier”)\nhave filed a complaint for injunctive and other relief pursuant to: (1) copyright infringement\nunder the copyright laws of the United States (17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq.); and (2) violations of the\nComputer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18.U.S.C. § 1030; based upon Defendants’ unlawful access to,\nuse, reproduction, and distribution of Elsevier’s copyrighted works. Elsevier has also filed an\nApplication for an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be granted\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65, 17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq., 18.U.S.C. § 1030, the common law, and\nthe All Writs Act (28 U.S.C. § 1651). Elsevier further seeks an order authorizing alternate\nservice of process on Defendants via e-mail.\nHaving reviewed the papers, declarations, exhibits, and memorandum filed in\nsupport of Plaintiff’s Application for an Order Authorizing Alternate Service of Process on\nDefendants and Order to Show Cause for Preliminary Injunction (the “Application”), the Court\nhereby finds:\n1. There is good cause to believe that Defendants have engaged in and are\nlikely to continue to engage in activities that violate the copyright laws of the United States (17\n3\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 5 Filed 06/11/15 Page 4 of 7\nU.S.C. § 101 et seq.) and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18.U.S.C. § 1030), and that\nElsevier is, therefore, likely to prevail on the merits of this action;\n2.

There is good cause to permit notice of the Preliminary Injunction hearing\nand service of the Complaint by alternative means – specifically, via e-mail on the websites and\ntheir domain registrants. Notice and service by the foregoing means satisfy Due Process, are\nappropriate, sufficient, and reasonable to apprise Defendants of this action, and are necessary\nunder the circumstances.\nIT IS THEREFORE:\nORDERED that copies of this Order, notice of the Preliminary Injunction\nhearing, and the Complaint may be served by any means authorized by law and this Order,\nincluding by e-mail transmission to the e-mail addresses available for Defendants on their\nwebsite or to the e-mail addresses of their domain registrants, as follows:\na.

Sci-Hu\"S:° Case # 15-c\\r~4282. ,J;,.·\nI am the main operator of sci-hub.org website mentioned in the case. That is true\nthat via sci-hub.org website anyone can download, absolutely for free, a copy of\nresearch paper published by Elsevier (Elsevier asks for 32 USD for each\ndownload).\nI would like to clarify the reasons behind sci-hub.org website. When I was a\nstudent in Kazakhstan university, I did not have access to any research papers.\nThese papers I needed for my research project. Payment of 32 dollars is just\ninsane when you need to skim or read tens or hundreds of these papers to do\nresearch. I obtained these papers by pirating them. Later I found there are lots\nand lots of researchers (not even students, but university researchers) just like\nme, especially in developing countries. They created online communities (forums)\nto solve this problem. I was an active participant in one of such communities in\nRussia. Here anyone who needs research paper, but cannot pay for it, could place\na request and other members who can obtain the paper will send it for free by\nemail. I could obtain any paper by pirating it, so I solved many requests and\npeople always were very grateful for my help. After that, I created sci-hub.org\nwebsite that simply makes this process automatic and the website immediately\nbecame popular.\nThat is true that website collects donations, however we do not pressure anyone\nto send them. Elsevier, in contrast, operates by racket: if you do not send money,\nyou will not read any papers. On my website, any person can read as many papers\nas they want for free, and sending donations is their free will. Why Elsevier\ncannot work like this, I wonder?\nI would also like to mention that Elsevier is not a creator of these papers. All\npapers on their website are written by researchers, and researchers do not\nreceive money from what Elsevier collects. That is very different from music or\nmovie industry, where creators receive money from each copy sold. But\neconomics of research papers is very different. Authors of these papers do not\nreceive money. Why would they send their work to Elsevier then? They feel\npressured to do this, because Elsevier is an owner of so-called \"high-impact\"\n\n1\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 50 Filed 09/15/15 Page 2 of 2\njournals. If a researcher wants to be recognized, make a career - he or she needs\nto have publications in such journals.\nWhat I written here is not just my opinion - this topic is widely discussed in\nresearch community. For example, a researcher John Willinsky wrote a book\nnamed \"The Access Principle: The Case for Open Access to Research and\nScholarship\" where he discusses this problem. The general opinion in research\ncommunity is that research papers should be distributed for free (open access},\nnot sold. And practices of such companies like Elsevier are unacceptable, because\nthey limit distribution of knowledge. In 2012, there was an \"Elsevier boycott\"\norganized by a prominent mathematician Timothy Gowers to battle such\npractices:\n\"The Cost of Knowledge is a protest by academics against the business\npractices of academic journal publisher Elsevier. Among the reasons for the\nprotests are a call for lower prices for journals and to promote increased open\naccess to information. The main work of the project is to ask researchers to\nsign a statement committing not to support Elsevier journals by publishing,\nperforming peer review, or providing editorial services for these journals.\"\nI would like to also mention that we never received any complaints from authors\nor researchers, only Elsevier is complaining about free distribution of knowledge\non sci-hub.erg website.\nBest regards,\nAlexandra Elbakyan,\nthe sci-hub.erg operator",

Based upon the\nfacts and conclusions below, the motion is granted and the\nDefendants are prohibited from distributing the Plaintiffs'\ncopyrighted works.\nPrior Proceedings\nElsevier, a major publisher of scientific journal articles\nand book chapters, brought this action on June 2, 2015, alleging\nthat the Defendants, a series of websites affiliated with the\nProject (the \"Website Defendants\") and their owner and operator,\nAlexandra Elbakyan, infringed Elsevier's copyrighted works and\nviolated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. (See generally\nComplaint, Dkt. No. 1.) Elsevier filed the instant motion for a\npreliminary injunction on June 11, 2015, via an Order to Show\nCause. (Dkt. Nos. 5-13.) On June 18, 2015, the Court granted\n2\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 53 Filed 10/30/15 Page 3 of 18\nPlaintiffs' Order to Show Cause and authorized service on the\nDefendants via email. (Dkt.

Nos. 24-31.)\nOn July 7, 2015, the Honorable Ronnie Abrams, acting as\nPart One Judge, held a telephone conference with the Plaintiffs\nand Elbakyan, during which Elbakyan acknowledged receiving the\npapers concerning this case and declared that she did not intend\nto obtain a lawyer. (See Transcript, Dkt. No. 38.) After the\nconference, Judge Abrams issued an Order directing Elbakyan to\nnotify the Court whether she wished assistance in obtaining pro\nbono counsel, and advising her that while she could proceed pro\nse, the Website Defendants, not being natural persons, must\nobtain counsel or risk default. (Dkt. No. 36.) A second\ntelephonic conference was held on July 14, 2015, during which\nElbakyan stated that she needed additional time to find a\nlawyer. (See Transcript, Dkt. No. 42.) Judge Abrams granted\nthe request, but warned Elbakyan \"you have to move quickly\nth~t\nboth in attempting to retain an attorney and you'll have to\nstick to the schedule that is set once it's set.\" (Id. at 6.)\nAfter the telephone conference, Judge Abrams issued another\nOrder setting the preliminary injunction hearing for September\n16 and directing Elbakyan to inform the Court by July 21 if she\nwished assistance in obtaining pro bono counsel.

None of the Defendants appeared at the\nhearing, although Elbakyan sent a two-page letter to the court\nthe day before. (Dkt. No. 50.)\nApplicable Standard\nPreliminary injunctions are \"extraordinary and drastic\nremed[ies] that should not be granted unless the movant, by a\nclear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.\" Mazurek v.\nArmstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997). In a copyright case, a\ndistrict court may, at its discretion, grant a preliminary\ninjunction when the plaintiffs demonstrate 1) a likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits, 2) irreparable harm in the absence of an\ninjunction, 3) a balance of the hardships tipping in their\nfavor, and 4) that issuance of an injunction would not do a\ndisservice to the public interest. WPIX, Inc. v. ivi, Inc., 691\nF.3d 275, 278 (2d Cir. 2012).\nThe Motion is Granted\nWith the exception of Elbakyan, none of the Defendants\nfiled any opposition to the instant motion, participated in any\nhearing or telephone conference, or in any other way appeared in\n4\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 53 Filed 10/30/15 Page 5 of 18\nthe case. Although Elbakyan acknowledges that she is the \"main\noperator of sci-hub.org website\" (Dkt. No. 50 at 1.), she may\nonly represent herself pro se; since the Website Defendants are\nnot natural persons, they may only be represented by an attorney\nadmitted to practice in federal court. See Max Cash Media, Inc.\nv. Prism Corp., No. 12 Civ. 147, 2012 WL 2861162, at *1\n(S.D.N.Y. July 9, 2012); Jones v. Niagara Frontier Transp.\nAuth., 722 F.2d 20, 22 (2d Cir. 1983) (stating reasons for the\nrule and noting that it is \"venerable and widespread\") . Because\nthe Website Defendants did not retain an attorney to defend this\naction, they are in default.\nHowever, the Website Defendants' default does not\nautomatically entitle the Plaintiffs to an injunction, nor does\nthe fact that Elbakyan's submission raises no merits-based\nchallenge to the Plaintiffs' claims. See Thurman v. Bun Bun\nMusic, No. 13 Civ. 5194, 2015 WL 2168134, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. May 7,\n2015). Instead, notwithstanding the default, the Plaintiffs\nmust present evidence sufficient to establish that they are\nentitled to injunctive relief. See id.; Gucci Am., Inc. v.\nCurveal Fashion, No. 09 Civ. 8458, 2010 WL 308303, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan 20, 2010); CFTC v. Vartuli, 228 F.3d 94, 98 (2d\nCir. 2000).\nA. Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n5\n\n.\n, Case 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 53 Filed 10/30/15 Page 6 of 18\nElsevier has established that the Defendants have\nreproduced and distributed its copyrighted works, in violation\nof the exclusive rights established by 17 U.S.C. § 106. (See\nComplaint, Dkt. No. 1, at 11-13.) In order to prevail on a\nclaim for infringement of copyright, \"two elements must be\nproven: (1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copying of\nconstituent elements of the work that are original.\" Arista\nRecords, LLC v. Doe 3, 604 F.3d 110, 117 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting\nFeist Publ'ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340, 361\n(1991)).\nElsevier has made a substantial evidentiary showing,\ndocumenting the manner in which the Defendants access its\nScienceDirect database of scientific literature and post\ncopyrighted material on their own websites free of charge.\nAccording to Elsevier, the Defendants gain access to\nScienceDirect by using credentials fraudulently obtained from\neducational institutions, including educational institutions\nlocated in the Southern District of New York, which are granted\nlegitimate access to ScienceDirect. · (See Declaration of Anthony\nWoltermann (the \"Woltermann Dec.\"), Dkt. No. 8, at 13-14.) As\nan attachment to one of the supporting declarations to this\nmotion, Elsevier includes a sequence of screenshots showing how\na user could go to ~ww.sc:-hub.org, one of the Website\n6\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 53 Filed 10/30/15 Page 7 of 18\nDefendants, search for information on a scientific article, get\na set of search results, click on a link, and be redirected to a\ncopyrighted article on ScienceDirect, via a proxy. (See\nWolterman Dec. at 41-44 and Ex. U.) Elsevier also points to a\nTwitter post (in Russian) indicating that whenever an article is\ndownloaded via this method, the Defendants save a copy on their\nown servers. (See Declaration of David M. Hirschberg, Dkt. No.\n12, Ex. B.) As specific examples, Elsevier includes copies of\ntwo of its articles accessed via the Defendants' websites, along\nwith their copyright registrations. (Declaration of Paul F.\nDoda, Dkt. No. 9, Exs. B-D.) This showing demonstrates a\nlikelihood of success on Elsevier's copyright infringement\nclaims.\nElsevier also shows a likelihood of success on its claim\nunder the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (\"CFAA\") . The CFAA\nprohibits, inter alia, obtaining information from \"any protected\ncomputer\" without authorization, 18 U. S.C. § 1030 (a) (2) (C), and\nobtaining anything of value by accessing any protected computer\nwith intent to defraud. Id. § (a) (4). The definition of\n\"protected computer\" includes one \"which is used in or affecting\ninterstate or foreign commerce or communication, including a\ncomputer located outside the United States that is used in a\nmanner that affects interstate or foreign commerce or\ncommunication of the United States.\" Id. § (el (2) (B); Nexans\n7\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 53 Filed 10/30/15 Page 8 of 18\n....\nWires S.A. v. Sark-USA, Inc., 166 F. App'x 559, 562 n.5 (2d Cir.\n2006). Elsevier's ScienceDirect database is located on multiple\nservers throughout the world and is accessed by educational\ninstitutions and their students, and qualifies as a computer\nused in interstate commerce, and therefore as a protected\ncomputer under the CFAA. (See Woltermann Dec. at 2-3.) As\nfound above, Elsevier has shown that the Defendants' access to\nScienceDirect was unauthorized and accomplished via fraudulent\nuniversity credentials. While the CfAA requires a civil\nplaintiff to have suffered over $5,000 in damage or loss, see\nRegister.com, Inc. v. Verio, Inc., 356 F.3d 393, 439 (2d Cir.\n2004), Elsevier has made the necessary showing since it\ndocumented between 2,000 and 8,500 of its articles being added\nto the LibGen database each day (Woltermann Dec. at 8, Exs. G &\nH) and because its articles carry purchase prices of between\n$19.95 and $41.95 each. Id. at 2; see Millennium TGA, Inc. v.\nLeon, No. 12 Civ. 1360, 2013 WL 5719079, at *10 (E.D.N.Y. Oct.\n18, 2013)\n.1\nElsevier's evidence is also buttressed by Elbakyan's\nsubmission, in which she frankly admits to copyright\ninfringement. (See Dkt. No. 50.) She discusses her time as a\n1 While Elsevier's articles are likely sufficient on their own to qualify as\n\"[]thing[s] of value\" under the CFAA, Elbakyan acknowledges in her submission\nthat the Defendants derive revenue from their website. (See Letter, Dkt. No.\n50, at 1 (\"That is true that website collects donations, however we do not\npressure anyone to send them.\").)\n8\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 53 Filed 10/30/15 Page 9 of 18\nstudent at a university in Kazakhstan, where she did not have\naccess to research papers and found the prices charged to be\n\"just insane.\" (Id. at 1.) She obtained the papers she needed\n\"by pirating them,\" and found may similar students and\nresearchers, predominantly in developing countries, who were in\nsimilar situations and helped each other illicitly obtain\nresearch materials that they could not access legitimately or\nafford on the open market. (Id.) As Elbakyan describes it, \"I\ncould obtain any paper by pirating it, so I solved many requests\nand people always were very grateful for my help. After that, I\ncreated sci-hub.org website that simply makes this process\nautomatic and the website immediately became popular.\" (Id.)\nGiven Elsevier's strong evidentiary showing and Elbakyan's\nadmissions, the first prong of the preliminary injunction test\nis firmly established.\nB. Irreparable Harm\nIrreparable harm is present \"where, but for the grant of\nequitable relief, there is a substantial chance that upon final\nresolution of the action the parties cannot be returned to the\npositions they previously occupied.\" Brenntag Int'l Chems.,\nInc. v. Bank of India, 175 F.3d 245, 249 (2d Cir. 1999). Here,\nthere is irreparable harm because it is entirely likely that the\n9\n\n.. Case 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 53 Filed 10/30/15 Page 10 of 18\ndamage to Elsevier could not be effectively quantified.\nRegister.com, 356 F.3d at 404 (\"irreparable harm may be found\nwhere damages are difficult to establish and measure.\"). It\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to determine how much\nmoney the Plaintiffs have lost due to the availability of\nthousands of their articles on the Defendant websites; some\npercentage of those articles would no doubt have been paid for\nlegitimately if they were not downloadable for free, but there\nappears to be no way of determining how many that would be.\nThere is also the matter of harm caused by \"viral infringement,\"\nwhere Elsevier's content could be transmitted and retransmitted\nby third parties who acquired it from the Defendants even after\nthe Defendants' websites were shut down. See WPIX, Inc. v. ivi,\nInc., 765 F. Supp. 2d 594, 620 (S.D.N.Y. 2011), aff'd 691 F.3d\n275 (2d Cir. 2012). \"[C]ourts have tended to issue injunctions\nin this context because 'to prove the loss of sales due to\ninfringement is notoriously difficult.'\" Salinger v.\nColting, 607 F.3d 68, 81 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting Omega Importing\nCorp. v. Petri-Kine Camera Co., 451 F.2d 1190, 1195 (2d Cir.\n1971) (Friendly, J.)).\nAdditionally, the harm done to the Plaintiffs is likely\nirreparable because the scale of any money damages would\ndramatically exceed Defendants' ability to pay. Brenntag, 175\nF.3d at 249-50 (explaining that even where money damages can be\n10\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 53 Filed 10/30/15 Page 11 of 18\nquantified, there is irreparable harm when a defendant will be\nunable to cover the damages). It is highly likely that the\nDefendants' activities will be found to be willful - Elbakyan\nherself refers to the websites' activities as \"pirating\" (Dkt.\nNo. 50 at 1) - in which case they would be liable for between\n$750 and $150,000 in statutory damages for each pirated work.\nSee 17 U.S.C. § 504(c); HarperCollins Publishers LLC v. Open\nRoad Integrated Media, LLP, 58 F. Supp. 3d 380, 387 (S.D.N.Y.\n2014). Since the Plaintiffs credibly allege that the Defendants\ninfringe an average of over 3,000 new articles each day\n(Woltermann Deel. at 7), even if the Court were to award damages\nat the lower end of the statutory range the Defendants'\nliability could be extensive. Since the Defendants are an\nindividual and a set of websites supported by voluntary\ndonations, the potential damages are likely to be far beyond the\nDefendants' ability to pay.\nC. Balance of Hardships\nThe balance of hardships clearly tips in favor of the\nPlaintiffs. Elsevier has shown that it is likely to succeed on\nthe merits, and that it continues to suffer irreparable harm due\nto the Defendants' making its copyrighted material available for\nfree. As for the Defendants, \"it is axiomatic that an infringer\n11\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 53 Filed 10/30/15 Page 12 of 18\nof copyright cannot complain about the loss of ability to offer\nits infringing product.\" WPIX, 691 F.3d at 287 (quotation\nomitted). The Defendants cannot be legally harmed by the fact\nthat they cannot continue to steal the Plaintiff's content, even\nif they tried to do so for public-spirited reasons. See id.\nD. Public Interest\nTo the extent that Elbakyan mounts a legal challenge to the\nmotion for a preliminary injunction, it is on the public\ninterest prong of the test. In her letter to the Court, she\nnotes that there are \"lots of researchers . especially in\ndeveloping countries\" who do not have access to key scientific\npapers owned by Elsevier and similar organizations, and who\ncannot afford to pay the high fees that Elsevier charges. (Dkt.\nNo. 50, at 1.) Elbakyan states in her letter that Elsevier\n\"operates by racket: if you do not send money, you will not read\nany papers. On my website, any person can read as many papers\nas they want for free, and sending donations is their free will.\nWhy Elsevier cannot work like this, I wonder?\" (Id.) Elbakyan\nalso notes that researchers do not actually receive money in\nexchange for granting Elsevier a copyright. (Id.) Rather, she\nalleges they give Elsevier ownership of their works \"because\nElsevier is an owner of so-called 'high-impact' journals. If a\n12\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 53 Filed 10/30/15 Page 13 of 18\nresearcher wants to be recognized, make a career - he or she\nneeds to have publications in such journals.\" (Id. at 1-2.)\nElbakyan notes that prominent researchers have made attempts to\nboycott Elsevier and states that \"[t]he general opinion in\nresearch community is that research papers should be distributed\nfor free (open access), not sold. And practices of such\ncompanies like Elsevier are unacceptable, because they limit\ndistribution of knowledge.\" (Id. at 2.)\nElsevier contends that the public interest favors the\nissuance of an injunction because doing so will \"protect the\ndelicate ecosystem which supports scientific research\nworldwide.\" (Pl.'s Br., Dkt. No. 6, at 21.) It states that the\nmoney it generates by selling access. to scientific research is\nused to support new discoveries, to create new journals, and to\nmaintain a \"definitive and accurate record of scientific\ndiscovery.\" (Id.) It also argues that allowing its articles to\nbe widely distributed risks the spread of bad science - while\nElsevier corrects and retracts articles whose conclusions are\nlater found to be flawed, it has no way of doing so when the\ncontent is taken out of its control. (Id. at 22.) Lastly,\nElsevier argues that injunctive relief against the Defendants is\nimportant to deter \"cyber-crime,\" while failing to issue an\ninjunction will incentivize pirates to continue to publish\ncopyrighted works.\n13\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 53 Filed 10/30/15 Page 14 of 18\nIt cannot be denied that there is a compelling public\ninterest in fostering scientific achievement, and that ensuring\nbroad access to scientific research is an important component of\nthat effort. As the Second Circuit has noted, \"[c]opyright law\ninherently balances [] two competing public interests . the\nrights of users and the public interest in broad accessibility\nof creative works, and the rights of copyright owners and the\npublic interest in rewarding and incentivizing creative efforts\n(the 'owner-user balance').\" WPIX, 691 F.3d at 287. Elbakyan's\nsolution to the problems she identifies, simply making\ncopyrighted content available for free via a foreign website,\ndisserves the public interest. As the Plaintiffs have\nestablished, there is a \"delicate ecosystem which supports\nscientific research worldwide,\" (Pl.'s Br., Dkt. No. 6 at 21),\nand copyright law pays a critical function within that system.\n\"Inadequate protections for copyright owners can threaten the\nvery store of knowledge to be accessed; encouraging the\nproduction of creative work thus ultimately serves the public's\ninterest in promoting the accessibility of such works.\" WPIX,\n691 F.3d at 287. The existence of Elsevier shows that\npublication of scientific research ~enerates substantial\neconomic value.\nThe public's interest in the broad diffusion of scientific\nknowledge is sustained by two critical exceptions in copyright\n14\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 53 Filed 10/30/15 Page 15 of 18\nlaw. First, the \"idea/expression dichotomy11 ensures that while\na scientific article may be subject to copyright, the ideas and\ninsights within that article are not. See 17 U.S.C. § 102(b)\n(\"In no case does copyright protection for an original work of\nauthorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system,\nmethod of operation, concept, principle, or discovery11 \"Due\n) •\nto this distinction, every idea, theory, and fact in a\ncopyrighted work becomes instantly available for public\nexploitation at the moment of publication. 11 Eldred v. Ashcroft,\n537 U.S. 186, 219 (2003). So while Elsevier may be able to keep\nits actual articles behind a paywall, the discoveries within\nthem are fair game for anyone. Secondly, the \"fair use11\ndoctrine, codified at 17 U.S.C. § 107, allows the public to use\nexpressions, as well as ideas, \"for purposes such as criticism,\ncomment, news reporting, teaching . . scholarship, or\nresearch11 without being liable for copyright infringement.\n(emphasis added) Under this doctrine, Elsevier's articles\nthemselves may be taken and used, but only for legitimate\npurposes, and not for wholesale infringement. See Eldred, 537\nU.S. at 219. 2 The public interest in the broad dissemination and\nuse of scientific research is protected by the idea/expression\ndichotomy and the fair use doctrine. See Golan v. Holder, 132\n2 The public interest in wide d1sseminat1on of scientific works is also served\nby the fact that copyrights are given only limited duration. See Sony Corp.\nof Am. V. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 431-32 (1984).\n15\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 53 Filed 10/30/15 Page 16 of 18\nS. Ct. 873, 890 (2012); Eldred, 537 U.S. at 219. Given the\nimportance of scientific research and the critical role that\ncopyright plays in promoting it, the public interest weighs in\nfavor of an injunction.\nConclusion\nFor the reasons set forth above, the motion for a\npreliminary injunction is granted. It is hereby ordered that:\n1. The Defendants, their officers, directors, principals,\nagents, servants, employees, successors and assigns, and\nall persons and entities in active concert or participation\nwith them, are hereby temporarily restrained from unlawful\naccess to, use, reproduction, and/or distribution of\nElsevier's copyrighted works and from assisting, aiding, or\nabetting any other person or business entity in engaging in\nunlawful access to, use, reproduction, and/or distribution\nof Elsevier's copyrighted works.\n2. Upon the Plaintiffs' request, those organizations which\nhave registered Defendants' domain names on behalf of\nDefendants shall disclose immediately to the Plaintiffs all\ninformation in their possession concerning the identity of\nthe operator or registrant of such domain names and of any\n16\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 53 Filed 10/30/15 Page 17 of 18\nbank accounts or financial accounts owned or used by such\noperator or registrant.\n3. Defendants shall not transfer ownership of the Defendants'\nwebsites during the pendency of this Action, or until\nfurther Order of the Court.\n4. The TLD Registries for the Defendants' websites, or their\nadministrators, shall place the domain names on\nregistryHold/serverHold as well as serverUpdate,\nserverDelete, and serverTransfer prohibited statuses, until\nfurther Order of the Court.\n5. The Defendants shall preserve copies of all computer files\nrelating to the use of the websites and shall take all\nnecessary steps to retrieve computer files relating to the\nuse of the websites that may have been deleted before entry\nof this Order.\n6. That security in the amount of $5,000 be posted by the\nPlaintiffs within one week of the entry of this Order. See\nFed. R. Civ.

(together “Plaintiffs” or\n“Elsevier”) respectfully submit this memorandum of law in support of their Application for an\nOrder Authorizing Alternative Service of Process and Order to Show Cause for Preliminary\nInjunction, and Order Transferring Domain Names, brought pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a) and\nthe Copyright Act, Title 17 United States Code § 502, against defendants Sci-Hub, Library\nGenesis Project, and Does 1-99.\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\nThe piracy of written materials is an extremely pervasive problem for the\npublishing industry in the Internet age. The ease by which infringers, acting under the cloak of\nanonymity afforded them on the Internet, are able to obtain, copy, store, and distribute\ncopyrighted works has resulted in an explosion in the number and scope of online piracy\noperations. These pirates act with impunity, infringing on the intellectual property rights of\npublishers while operating largely in nations where they believe themselves to be immune from\nthe remedies provided for by American and International law. Moreover, their use of\nanonymization services to hide their true identities when registering websites and acceptance of\ndifficult or impossible to track methods of payment has allowed these criminals to monetize their\nunlawful activities.\nThis action relates to Elsevier’s discovery of a piracy operation more expansive\nand sophisticated than any it has ever before encountered. Defendants’ scheme has already\nresulted in the widespread piracy of tens of millions of works published by Elsevier and other\nscientific publishers, and, if not prevented from doing so, will continue to expand in scope.\n1\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 6 Filed 06/11/15 Page 8 of 38\nThrough their websites, Defendants have engaged in the systematic copying and\ndistribution of copyrighted scientific articles and book chapters published by Elsevier and a\nbroad range of other science and medical publishers. The scale of the Defendants’ operation is\nsimply staggering – according to Defendants’ own statements, they have already unlawfully\nduplicated nearly 40 million technical works and continue to acquire such content at a rate of\nmore than 1 million works per month.\nDefendants’ actions are not only civil wrongs, but constitute criminal offenses as\nwell. In addition to criminal copyright infringement and unauthorized computer access in\nviolation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, Defendants’ conduct also likely violates Title\n18, United States Code, Sections 1029 (fraud and related activity in connection with access\ndevices), 2 (aiding and abetting) and 371 (conspiracy).\nPlaintiffs now apply for a Preliminary Injunction in order to prevent the\nirreparable harm which will otherwise occur prior to a ruling on the merits of this case.\nDefendants’ actions cause severe injury to Elsevier (and the entire scientific publishing industry)\nnot only through the rampant piracy of copyrighted materials, but also through the persistent\nunauthorized intrusion into protected computers Elsevier uses to provide the ScienceDirect\nplatform to its authorized users. Moreover, since that persistent unauthorized intrusion originates\nthrough the “hijacking” of the protected computer systems of the world’s academic institutions,\nan injunction will protect these institutions from Defendants’ unauthorized access to and use of\ntheir systems and accounts (well beyond just Elsevier’s ScienceDirect), as well as the possible\nintroduction of malware or means for identity theft or other crimes.\n2\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 6 Filed 06/11/15 Page 9 of 38\nIn addition, an injunction will also help protect the public from the Defendants’\nrogue, “un-curated” database. Absent efforts to prevent the continued growth and dissemination\nof Defendants’ database, when the scientific record is corrected (through standard industry\npractices for retraction and correction), scientists, doctors, and researchers who use Defendants’\nsites will in many cases continue to rely on “bad science.”\nPlaintiffs respectfully submit that an order allowing service of process, and all\nsubsequent pleadings and discovery, via e-mail in this case will benefit all parties and the Court\nby ensuring Defendant received immediate notice of the pendency of this action and by allowing\nthis action to move forward expeditiously. Absent ability to serve Defendants by e-mail,\nElsevier will almost certainly be left without the ability to pursue a remedy.\nI. STATEMENT OF FACTS\nA. Elsevier’s ScienceDirect Platform\nElsevier is the world’s leading publisher of scientific, technical, engineering, and\nmedical (“STEM”) publications, distributing more than 2,500 scientific journals and more than\n33,000 books in the STEM fields.1 One way in which Elsevier distributes these publications is\nthrough its Internet-based “ScienceDirect” platform, which is accessible through the Web at\nwww.sciencedirect.com.2 Through ScienceDirect, professional and educational users can access\nmore than 33,000 books and approximately 12.3 million journal articles in the STEM fields,\neither by a-la-carte purchases or through institutional subscriptions.3 Elsevier owns the\ncopyright in a substantial portion of the publications available through ScienceDirect and is the\n1 Declaration of Paul F. Doda, Esq., dated May 6, 2015 (“Doda Decl.”) ¶ 4.\n2 Id. ¶ 5.\n3 Id.\n3\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 6 Filed 06/11/15 Page 10 of 38\nexclusive licensee of the copyright in the majority of the works available through ScienceDirect\nto which it does not own the copyright.4 As a regular business practice, Elsevier obtains federal\nregistrations protecting its copyrights in the publications it distributes through ScienceDirect.5\nEducational institutions, and particularly large research universities, are often\nsubscribers to ScienceDirect.6 Through these subscriptions, a university’s faculty and students\nhave access to a substantial portion of the world’s published scientific knowledge and can use\nthose materials to further their research and studies.7 In many cases, the terms of a university’s\nScienceDirect subscription will allow for unlimited access to the platform by authorized faculty\nand students.8\nIn order to facilitate efficient operation of the platform, the STEM content\navailable on ScienceDirect is stored on and transmitted through a distributed network of\ncomputer servers.9 Through the use of this network, users are often able to access scientific\nmaterials on a server which is physically near to the user’s location.10\nB. Remote Access to ScienceDirect\nStudents and faculty often desire to conduct scientific research from locations\nother than those physically on the campus of a university. In order to accommodate this,\n4 Id. ¶ 6.\n5 Id.¶ 7.\n6 Declaration of Anthony Woltermann, dated June 10, 2015 (“Woltermann Decl.”) ¶ 6-7.\n7 Doda Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.\n8 Woltermann Decl. ¶ 59.\n9 Id. ¶¶ 8-9.\n10 Id. ¶ 9.\n4\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 6 Filed 06/11/15 Page 11 of 38\nElsevier provides university-affiliated users the ability to connect to ScienceDirect from remote\nlocations.11 Elsevier accomplishes this by (1) verifying that a user is an authorized university\nstudent or faculty member, and then (2) authenticating the user’s computer as permitted to access\nScienceDirect through that university’s subscription.12 Once authorized, a user’s ability to\nremotely access ScienceDirect persists for a limited time, after which the user must re-\nauthenticate.13 Initial authentication of a user’s computer to connect to ScienceDirect may be\naccomplished either by connecting physically to the university’s computing network (i.e., on-\ncampus), or by connecting to that network remotely through a university-provided proxy\nservice.14\nC. Defendant Library Genesis Project’s Infringing Conduct\nThe Library Genesis Project operates the website “libgen.org,” at which it hosts a\nmassive repository of infringing content, together with a specialized search engine which allows\nits users to locate and download copies of pirated content.15 The Library Genesis Project claims\nto host approximately 1 million scientific and technical books, as well as 40 million scientific\njournal articles.16 Elsevier has investigated the Library Genesis Project and has verified that it\n11 Id. ¶ 10.\n12 Id. ¶¶ 11-14.\n13 Id. ¶ 11.\n14 Id. ¶¶ 13-14.\n15 Id. ¶ 15.\n16 Id. ¶¶ 19-20.\n5\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 6 Filed 06/11/15 Page 12 of 38\ndoes, in fact, make available for download, at no cost and without Elsevier’s permission, an array\nof Elsevier’s copyrighted works.17\nPerhaps in order to facilitate the creation of mirrors of the site and its repository,\nthe Library Genesis Project makes available for download copies of its search databases.18\nElsevier has investigated two of these databases – specifically those relating to technical books\nand scientific articles – and has identified more than 29,000 Elsevier imprint book titles and\napproximately 12 million articles with Elsevier branding that the Project presents as available for\nillegal distribution through its website.19 In addition to Elsevier’s copyrighted works, the Library\nGenesis Project appears to host millions of works belonging to other scientific, technical, and\nmedical publishers.20\nElsevier has attempted to remove its copyrighted works from the Library Genesis\nProject’s repository through the DMCA notice-and-takedown regime, but the combination of the\nmassive volume of works, the constant addition of new copies of works, and the lack of effective\nresponse from Defendants has rendered the effort futile.21 Elsevier has also brought this issue to\nthe attention of the Public Interest Registry (“PIR”), the domain registry for the .org top-level\ndomain.22 Specifically, Elsevier asked for the relief requested herein (i.e., the disabling of Sci-\n17 Id. ¶ 21.\n18 Id. ¶ 22.\n19 Id. ¶ 23.\n20 Declaration of Edward M.

Library Genesis Project Mirrors\nAs noted above, the Library Genesis Project appears to encourage its users to\nmake copies of the infringing content stored on its servers so as to facilitate further infringing\nactivity.31 Elsevier has been able to identify several other domains, including elibgen.org,\nlibgen.info, lib.estrorecollege.org, and bookfi.org, which direct visitors to websites which act\nas “mirrors” of the Library Genesis site.32 Visitors to these domains are typically given access to\na search engine which appears to provide access to the Library Genesis Project’s repository or a\ncopy thereof.33 In so doing, these mirror sites perform substantially similar infringing functions\nas does the Library Genesis Project’s “official” website and serve to amplify the already massive\ninfringement of copyrighted works.\nE. Defendant Sci-Hub’s Unauthorized Access to ScienceDirect\nand Infringing Conduct\nDefendant Sci-Hub operates the website Sci-Hub.org, which enables its users to\nunlawfully obtain copyrighted scientific works from a number of commercial repositories of\nSTEM materials, including ScienceDirect.34 Sci-Hub accomplishes this goal by obtaining\ncompromised student credentials to university proxy servers and using those stolen credentials to\nauthenticate access to ScienceDirect.35 Sci-Hub users who request an article or book from\nScienceDirect may be granted access to ScienceDirect through a Sci-Hub proxy.36 Because Sci-\n31 Id. ¶ 22.\n32 Id. ¶ 30.

Sci-Hub’s Cooperation with the Library Genesis Project’s Infringements\nIn the course of its investigation into the Defendants’ activities, Elsevier learned\nthat, at some point, Sci-Hub began populating the Library Genesis Project with copies of the\narticles it was obtaining from intrusions into Elsevier and other publishers’ databases.45 As a\nresult, when a user searches for content on Sci-Hub using a unique identifier, Sci-Hub now only\nprovides its users with content as described section I.E, supra, if the content is not already\navailable from the Library Genesis Project’s repository.46 If, however, a Sci-Hub user searches\nfor a copyrighted work already stored in the Library Genesis Project repository using a unique\nidentifier, Sci-Hub will instead retrieve that content from the Library Genesis Project rather than\nobtain a “new” infringing copy from ScienceDirect (or, as applicable, a platform operated by\nanother STEM publisher).47 Defendants show no signs of stopping their massive piracy scheme\nabsent compulsion; indeed, Sci-Hub’s stated goal is to continue to contribute pirated works to the\nLibrary Genesis Project so that the growing illegal repository can become a more complete\nsource of pirated materials and in the process, a substitute for legal sources of the content.48\nThrough this symbiosis, Sci-Hub and the Library Genesis Project act in concert to orchestrate a\n43 Id. ¶ 47.\n44 Id. ¶ 51.\n45 Hirschberg Decl. ¶ 3, Exhibit F (VK posting dated June 2, 2015).\n46 Woltermann Decl. ¶¶ 44-45.\n47 Id. ¶ 44.\n48 Id. ¶ 48.\n10\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 6 Filed 06/11/15 Page 17 of 38\ncomplex, efficient scheme to pirate a substantial portion of the world’s published scientific\nmaterials to the detriment of Elsevier, other STEM publishers, and, as described below, the\nscientific community and public at large.\nG. Alexandra Elbakyan’s Operation of Sci-Hub\nAlthough the Sci-Hub.org website is registered anonymously, there is strong\nevidence to suggest that Alexandra Elbakyan, a resident of Almaty, Kazakhstan, is one of, if not\nthe primary, operator of Sci-Hub. In addition, Elbakyan may also be substantially involved in\nthe operation of the Library Genesis Project or one of its mirrors. According to her biography on\nthe website lifeboat.com, Elbakyan is a graduate of the Kazakh National Technical University in\nAlmaty, Kazakhstan, where she specialized in information security.49\nSocial media profiles associated with Sci-Hub strongly suggest Elbakyan’s\ninvolvement. Sci-Hub’s profile on Copiny (a Russian-language business networking site) lists\nElbakyan as Sci-Hub’s creator.50 Elbakyan maintains Sci-Hub’s presence on VK (a Russian\nsocial networking site).51 In a May 31, 2015, posting to the Sci-Hub VK page, Elbakyan\nexpressly states that she is the founder, operator, and programmer of Sci-Hub.52 In addition, Sci-\n49 Hirschberg Decl. ¶ 5, Exhibit H.

The WHOIS records for\nthese domain names provide the email address mindwrapper@gmail.com for Elbakyan and\nindicate a mailing address of Teslenko, 172, Almaty, Kazakhstan 050014.55 A search of public\nrecords indicates that the street in Almaty formerly known as “Teslenko” has since been renamed\n“Zhumabaeva.”56\nII.

Plaintiffs are Entitled to a Preliminary Injunction Enjoining Defendants’\nInfringing Acts and Disabling Defendants’ Domain Names\nSection 502(a) of the Copyright Act provides that a court may “grant temporary\nand final injunctions on such terms at it may deem reasonable to prevent or restrain infringement\nof a copyright.” This Court also has authority to enjoin the conduct of Defendant Sci-Hub\npursuant to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1030(g).\nTo obtain a preliminary injunction, a party must demonstrate that: (1) it is likely\nto succeed on the merits; (2) it is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary\nrelief; (3) the balance of equities tips in its favor; and (4) an injunction is in the public interest.\nWinter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 129 S. Ct. 365, 374 (2008). In the context of a\ncopyright claim, a “preliminary injunction is appropriate when: (1) the plaintiff demonstrates\neither a likelihood of success on the merits or sufficiently serious questions going to the merits\nand a balance of hardships tipping decidedly in the plaintiff’s favor; (2) the plaintiff\ndemonstrates that he is likely to suffer irreparable injury in the absence of an injunction; (3) the\nbalance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant tips in the plaintiff’s favor; and (4) the\n“public interest would not be disserved by the issuance of a preliminary injunction.” WPIX Inc.\nv. ivi Inc., 765 F.Supp.2d 594, 601 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (citing Salinger v.

Elsevier is Likely to Succeed in its Copyright Claims against\nDefendants\nTo prevail on their copyright claims, Plaintiffs must prove, inter alia, “(1)\nownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copying of constituent elements of the work that are\noriginal. The word ‘copying’ is shorthand for the infringing of any of the copyright owner’s five\nexclusive rights described in § 106.” Getty Images (US) v. Microsoft Corp., No. 14-cv-7114,\n2014 WL 6633032, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 24, 2014) (citing Arista Records LLC v. Doe 3, 604\nF.3d 110, 117 (2d Cir. 2010). Among these exclusive rights are reproduction and distribution.\n17 U.S.C. § 106. For purposes of infringement analysis, exclusive licensees are regarded as\ncopyright owners. See, e.g., Morris v. Business Concepts, Inc., 259 F.3d 65, 70 (2d Cir. 2001),\n17 U.S.C. § 201(d)(2).\nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on their copyright claims. Elsevier is either the\nowner or exclusive licensee of the copyrights in the vast majority of the works it distributes\nthrough its ScienceDirect platform.57 Moreover, Elsevier is the owner of a substantial number of\nfederally-registered copyrights in the works distributed through the ScienceDirect platform,\nincluding many of those unlawfully made available through Defendants’ websites.58\nAs to Defendant Library Genesis Project, Plaintiffs have reviewed databases\nenumerating the works that the Library Genesis Project makes available through its repository\nand have confirmed that the databases list millions of Plaintiffs’ copyrighted works.59 Plaintiffs\nhave verified Defendants’ infringing activities by downloading several Elsevier-published works\n57 Doda Decl. ¶ 6.\n58 Id. ¶¶ 7, 11-13.\n59 Woltermann Decl. ¶¶ 23-24.\n14\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 6 Filed 06/11/15 Page 21 of 38\nfrom the Library Genesis Project and verifying that the files are substantially identical to\nElsevier’s copyrighted works legally available through ScienceDirect.60 Other major STEM\npublishers have also observed similar infringements of their copyright-protected works\nfacilitated by Defendants.61\n2. Elsevier is Likely to Succeed in its CFAA Claim against Sci-Hub\nThe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (“CFAA”) prohibits the actions of an entity\nwhich “intentionally accesses a computer without authorization … and thereby obtains\ninformation from any protected computer.” 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(2)(C). In addition, the CFAA\nprohibits the actions of one who “knowingly and with intent to defraud, accesses a protected\ncomputer without authorization … and by means of such conduct furthers the intended fraud and\nobtains anything of value.” 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(4).\nFor purposes of the CFAA, a “protected computer” includes any computer “which\nis used in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or communication, including a computer\nlocated outside the United States that is used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign\ncommerce or communication of the United States.” 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(2)(B). Civil remedies\nare available to any person who suffers economic damage in an amount exceeding $5,000 as a\nresult of a CFAA violation and may obtain compensatory damages and injunctive or other\nequitable relief. 18 U.S.C. § 1030(g).\nThe computing systems from which Elsevier’s ScienceDirect platform are\n“protected computers” under the CFAA because they are designed and function to distribute\n60 Doda Decl. ¶¶ 12, 13.\n61 McKenzie Decl. ¶ 5; Hawkins Decl. ¶ 4.\n15\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 6 Filed 06/11/15 Page 22 of 38\ncopyrighted works, for a fee (either through subscription or a-la-carte purchases), through\ninterstate commerce.62 Defendant Sci-Hub intentionally accesses the ScienceDirect platform\nwithout authorization through its use of stolen access credentials.\nSci-Hub’s ongoing unauthorized access to ScienceDirect has caused, and\ncontinues to cause, significant economic loss to Elsevier in an amount far in excess of $5,000.\nSci-Hub has likely used its unauthorized access to ScienceDirect to obtain thousands, if not\nmillions, of Elsevier’s copyrighted works therefrom, and, in the majority of cases, each of these\nworks has a value of between $19.95 and $41.95.63 Moreover, Sci-Hub’s unauthorized access to\nScienceDirect is intrinsically linked to Sci-Hub’s ongoing identity fraud targeting the university\nstudents whose access credentials Sci-Hub misappropriates. Accordingly, Elsevier is likely to\nsucceed on its CFAA claim.\n3. Defendants’ Conduct Causes Irreparable Harm to Elsevier\nDefendants’ infringing activities irreparably harm Elsevier and the public. No\nmonetary remedy conceivably recoverable in this action could repair the harm which will be\nendured by Elsevier should the Defendants be permitted to carry on their unlawful scheme\nthrough their websites.\nIn order to obtain a preliminary injunction in a copyright case, in addition to\nmaking out a prima facie case of infringement, “Plaintiffs must show that, on the facts of their\ncase, the failure to issue an injunction would actually cause irreparable harm.” Salinger, 607\nF.3d at 82, see also Citibank, NA v. Citytrust, 756 F.2d 273, 275 (2d Cir. 1985) (“Perhaps the\n62 Woltermann Decl. ¶¶ 5, 59.\n63 Id. ¶ 5.\n16\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 6 Filed 06/11/15 Page 23 of 38\nsingle most important prerequisite for the issuance of a preliminary injunction is a demonstration\nthat if it is not granted the applicant is likely to suffer irreparable harm before a decision on the\nmerits can be rendered.”) (citations omitted).\nPlaintiffs have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable harm as the result\nof Defendants’ ongoing infringement for a number of reasons. As a preliminary matter, Plaintiff\nwill suffer irreparable harm because, should an injunction not issue, Plaintiff will, solely on the\nbasis of Defendants’ continued massive infringement during the course of these proceedings, be\nentitled to damages far in excess of Defendants’ ability to pay. See, e.g., Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\nStudios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 518 F.Supp.2d 1197, 1217 (C.D. Cal. 2007) (“Because it is\nextremely unlikely that (defendants) will be able to compensate Plaintiffs monetarily for the\ninfringements it has induced in the past, or the infringements it could induce in the future …\nPlaintiffs have and will continue to suffer irreparable harm”), see also Arista Records LLC v.\nLime Wire LLC, No. 06 CIV. 05936, 2010 WL 10031251 (“Arista Records”), at *3 (S.D.N.Y.\nAug. 9, 2010) (“Plaintiffs face irreparable harm because it is virtually certain that they will be\nentitled to an enormous damage award after trial that will far exceed Lime Wire's ability to\npay.”); Salinger, 607 F.3d at 81 (“Harm might be irremediable, or irreparable, for many reasons,\nincluding that a loss is difficult to replace or difficult to measure, or that it is a loss that one\nshould not be expected to suffer. . . . And courts have tended to issue injunctions in [the\ncopyright] context because to prove the loss of sales due to infringement is ... notoriously\ndifficult.”) (internal quotations omitted); WPIX, 765 F.Supp.2d at 617 (same).\nIn this action, Plaintiffs seek statutory damages under the Copyright Act for\nDefendants’ unlawful infringement of their works. Given (1) the brazenness of Defendants’\nactions, (2) their own statements detailing their knowledge that their actions are infringing, (3)\n17\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 6 Filed 06/11/15 Page 24 of 38\ntheir encouragement of their users to participate in their infringement, and (4) the massive scale\nof their piracy operation, a finding that Defendants’ infringement is willful is almost inevitable.\nSee Branch v. Ogilvy & Mather Inc., 772 F.Supp. 1359, 1364 (S.D.N.Y. 1991) (finding of\nwillfulness requires showing defendant knew or should have known actions constitute\ninfringement), see also Grokster, 518 F.Supp.2d at 1217 (inducement can support finding of\nwillfulness), Arista Records, at *3 (same). Accordingly, Plaintiffs will almost certainly be\nentitled to statutory damages of up to $150,000 per infringed work. 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(2).\nEven if Plaintiffs are unable to show Defendants’ conduct constitutes willful\ninfringement and Defendants can somehow prove they were entirely unaware of the unlawful\nnature of their actions, Plaintiffs will be entitled to statutory damages in an amount no less than\n$200 per infringed work. Id. Given, however, that the number of Plaintiffs’ works being\ninfringed per day is likely greater than 10,000, these statutory damages would accrue at a rate\nbetween approximately $2 million to $1.5 billion per day going forward. As was the case in\nGrokster, these damages are “so staggering” as to “very probably be well beyond” Defendants’\nresources. Grokster, 518 F.Supp.2d at 1217.\nDefendants’ actions also threaten imminent irreparable harm to Elsevier because\nit appears that the Library Genesis Project repository may be approaching (or will eventually\napproach) a level of “completeness” where it can serve as a functionally equivalent, although\npatently illegal, replacement for ScienceDirect. The Library Genesis Project already contains a\nvast majority of the articles ScienceDirect users request most often, and Elsevier has already\nobserved that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find an article that Sci-Hub retrieves from\n18\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 6 Filed 06/11/15 Page 25 of 38\nScienceDirect rather than from the Library Genesis Project.64 Moreover, Sci-Hub’s own\nstatements indicate that it anticipates reducing its proxy activities in the near future as “in the\nfuture, there will no longer be any need to download most articles through the proxy, but simply\nfrom the library.”65 Sci-Hub is currently pirating journal articles from ScienceDirect at a furious\npace, and is thus drawing ever closer to the point where it can become an illegal commercial\nsubstitute for ScienceDirect.\nFinally, Defendants’ actions threaten irreparable harm to Elsevier because those\nactions could give rise to “viral infringement” – i.e., that once the pirated works are “in the wild”\non the Internet for free, Elsevier will be entirely unable to prevent third parties who have\nobtained unlawful copies of Elsevier’s works from redistributing them to others. Indeed, this\nCourt has recognized that the loss of control due to viral infringement is a “potentially serious\nharm[].” WPIX, 765 F.Supp.2d at 620; see also Arista Records, at *4 (characterizing\ninfringement of digital music as capable of “spawn[ing] countless derivative infringing copies”\nwhich threatens “virtually unstoppable infringement of the copyright”) (citing cases).\n4. The Balance of Hardships Tips Decidedly in Plaintiff’s Favor\nAs set forth above, Plaintiffs have established the requisite likelihood of success\non their Copyright and CFAA claims. Nevertheless, should the Court have any concern\nregarding Plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits, Plaintiffs should still prevail in their\napplication for a preliminary injunction because they have at least raised serious questions\nregarding the merits of their claims and that the balance of hardships tips heavily in their favor.\n64 Woltermann Decl. ¶ 21.\n65 Id. ¶ 48.\n19\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 6 Filed 06/11/15 Page 26 of 38\nSee Seide v. Crest Color, Inc., 835 F. Supp. 732, 738 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (“A ‘balance of the\nhardships tipping decidedly toward the party requesting preliminary relief’ must be shown only\nwhen a movant fails to sufficiently demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits, and can\ninstead make out only ‘sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them fair\nground for litigation.’”) (citing ICN Pharmaceuticals, 2 F.3d 484, 490 (2d Cir. 1993)), see also\nMONY Group, Inc. v. Highfields Capital Mgmt, L.P., 368 F.3d 138, 143 (2d Cir. 2004) (“To\nsecure a preliminary injunction in district court, the moving party must demonstrate (1) that it\nwill be irreparably harmed in the absence of an injunction, and (2) either (a) a likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits or (b) sufficiently serious questions going to the merits of the case to make\nit a fair ground for litigation, and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly in its favor.”) (quoting\nForest City Daly Hous., Inc. v. Town of North Hempstead, 175 F.3d 144, 149 (2d Cir.1999));\nDiesel Props S.R.L. v. Greystone Bus. Credit II LLC, No. 07 CIV. 9580, 2008 WL 594773, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 5, 2008).\nFor the same reasons that the Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claims,\nPlaintiffs have raised serious questions regarding the merits of their claims, making them fair\nground for litigation. In addition, the balance of hardships is entirely in Plaintiffs’ favor.\nDefendants’ actions present a substantial threat to the survival of Plaintiffs’ ongoing legitimate\nbusiness in that, should the Defendants’ infringing activities not be halted, their unlawful\ninfringing library could conceivably become a substitute for ScienceDirect among scientific\nresearchers. On the other hand, the harm to Defendants should an injunction issue will be\nnegligible. First, it is axiomatic that Defendants have no legitimate interest in the illegal copying\nor redistribution of Plaintiffs’ copyrighted works (or, for that matter, the copyrighted works of\nother publishers whose rights will also be protected by an injunction) or to continue to engage in\n20\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 6 Filed 06/11/15 Page 27 of 38\nunauthorized computer access in violation of the CFAA. See Arista Records, at *5 (noting that\n“massive scale of infringement through the Lime Wire client has caused great and irreparable\ninjury and any harm to Lime Wire is far outweighed by that injury”); see also WPIX, 765\nF.Supp.2d at 620-21 (“While it is a practical hardship for [defendant] to go out of business, it is\nnot a legally recognized harm. It is axiomatic that an infringer of copyright cannot complain\nabout the loss of ability to offer its infringing product”). Second, to the extent that Defendants\nare deprived of the “donations” they obtain from users to support their illegal scheme – even\nassuming that Defendants have the right to such “donations” – that concern can be adequately\nremedied through Plaintiffs’ posting of a bond.66\n5. Disabling Defendants’ Domain Names and Issuing a Preliminary\nInjunction Will Serve the Public Interest\nBeyond the protection of Elsevier’s legitimate interests in the copyright in its\nworks and in the security of its computer systems, an injunction disabling Defendants’ domain\nnames and barring further infringement will serve the public interest in three ways.\nFirst, an injunction will protect the delicate ecosystem which supports scientific\nresearch worldwide. The subscription and per-article fees charged by Elsevier and other STEM\npublishers are used to support the dissemination and discovery of scientific research, the creation\nof new journals in new fields of research, the maintenance of a definitive and accurate record of\nscientific discovery, and the academic tenure process.67\nSecond, an injunction will safeguard the quality of published scientific research\nand, in some cases, prevent harm to the safety or health of members of the public. Elsevier and\n66 DeMarco Decl. ¶ 10.\n67 Doda Decl. ¶ 14.\n21\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 6 Filed 06/11/15 Page 28 of 38\nother STEM publishers take significant steps to correct or retract scientific publications which\nare found to be flawed or erroneous.68 These corrections and retractions are reflected in the\nonline databases – such as ScienceDirect – operated by those publishers. Defendants, however,\ndo not participate in this curation process, which will result in their repository’s inclusion of\nerroneous or discredited research. In the worst of all circumstances, these uncorrected errors\ncould threaten the public health or safety. For example, a medical article which contains a\ntypographical error in a dosing chart for a new drug could, if uncorrected and relied upon by user\nof Defendants’ services, result in the provision of dangerous or ineffective treatment to a\npatient.69 Elsevier has verified that in at least some cases, articles retracted from ScienceDirect\nremain accessible for distribution through Defendants’ website with no indication that those\narticles have been retracted.70\nThird, an injunction will protect universities and their students from being the\nvictims of other forms of cyber-crime. As discussed supra at II. D., Defendant Sci-Hub obtains\naccess to university computer systems through compromised student credentials. In at least\nsome cases, Sci-Hub accomplishes this by paying for those credentials – itself a criminal act.71\nWhile Plaintiffs are only aware of Defendants’ criminal actions as they implicate the CFAA and\nthe Copyright Act, a malicious actor in possession of such credentials can engage in a broad\narray of other crimes. These include, but are not limited to, the deployment of malware or\n68 Id. ¶ 15.\n69 Id. ¶ 17.\n70 Id. ¶¶ 18-19.\n71 Woltermann Decl. ¶ 51.\n22\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 6 Filed 06/11/15 Page 29 of 38\nbotnets, the launching of attacks on third-party computer systems from the compromised\nuniversity system, and identity theft using personal information obtainable from those systems.72\nFourth, an injunction protecting the Plaintiff’s interest here will serve the public\nby incentivizing the Plaintiff to continue to publish these copyrighted works. As the Second\nCircuit has stated, “The object of copyright law is to promote the store of knowledge available to\nthe public. But to the extent it accomplishes this end by providing individuals a financial\nincentive to contribute to the store of knowledge, the public’s interest may well be already\naccounted for by the plaintiff’s interest.” Salinger, 607 F.3d at 82.\n6. An Injunction Disabling Defendants’ Domains Can Avoid Further\nIrreparable Harm to Elsevier\nPlaintiffs’ application is directed toward Defendants’ domains within the .org and\n.info top-level domains, each of which is operated by an organization with a physical presence in\nthe United States.73 Defendants likely use these domains because .org and .info are analogous to\n“prime real estate” in the physical world. Quite simply, a typical user is more likely to be able to\nfind a website if it is hosted within the most popular top-level domains. Moreover, in the case of\n.org, which is operated by the Public Interest Registry, presence within the top-level domain can\ngive the Defendants’ websites the appearance of legitimate, public-interest websites, rather than\nthe vehicles for overt and brazen copyright infringement and hacking which they actually are.74\nThis Court should also issue an injunction disabling and preventing the transfer of\nthe Defendants’ domain names because absent such an injunction, Plaintiffs are likely to be\n72 Id. ¶ 60.\n73 DeMarco Decl. ¶ 3.\n74 Id. ¶ 4.\n23\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 6 Filed 06/11/15 Page 30 of 38\ndeprived of any effective remedy.75 Although Plaintiffs seek monetary damages in this case,\npractical realities dictate that even if that remedy is granted, the relief will be far from sufficient\nto make Plaintiff whole. If this Court ultimately finds in Plaintiffs’ favor on the issue of\ninfringement, the sheer number of Plaintiffs’ works the Defendants’ have infringed would call\nfor an award far in excess of, and perhaps several orders of magnitude greater than, that which\nthe Defendants will have the ability to pay. Even if Defendants possessed substantial assets\nwhich could be used to satisfy a judgment against them, Plaintiffs have no reason to believe that\nDefendants, who are likely physically located in countries beyond the reach of this Court’s\nenforcement power, would actually pay any meaningful portion of those damages.76\n7. The All Writs Act Authorizes the Court to Direct Registries to Disable\nDefendants’ Domain Names\nPlaintiff’s proposed order directs third-party top-level domain registries to take\nsteps to disassociate Defendants’ domain names from the IP addresses of Defendants’ websites,\nthus preventing Internet users from accessing those websites through the use of those domain\n75 Elsevier also requests that this Court issue an Order permitting Elsevier to cancel any redirections Defendants may\nhave entered into Google’s Webmaster Tools which could be used to divert search traffic for the Defendants’\ndomain names to other URLs. In this manner, Defendants would be unable to frustrate an order disabling the\nDefendants’ domain names by smoothly transitioning their content to new domains. See DeMarco Decl. ¶ 9.\n76 Courts in this District have issued preliminary relief disabling domains in the context of large-scale IP\ninfringement involving overseas defendants. See True Religion Apparel v. Xiaokang Lei, No. 11-cv-08242\n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 30, 2011) (Preliminary Injunction, at Dkt. 6) (disabling domain names of counterfeiters); North\nFace Apparel v. Fujian Sharing Import & Export, No. 10-cv-1630 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 16, 2010) (Temporary\nRestraining Order, at Dkt. 15) (ex parte preliminary order disabling counterfeiters’ domain names). See alsoPhillip\nMorris USA, Inc. v. Otamedia, Ltd., 331 F.Supp. 2d. 228, 247 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (modifying default judgment to\ntransfer trademark infringer’s domain names to plaintiff); Pearson Educ. Inc. v. Nugroho, No 08-cv-8034 (S.D.N.Y.\nOct. 10, 2013) (order modifying permanent injunction, at Dkt. 53) (same); Elsevier v. Kozlov, No. 14-cv-2422\n(S.D.N.Y. April 13, 2015) (Default Judgment and Permanent Injunction, at Dkt. 58) (granting plaintiff leave to\nmove for supplemental relief, including domain name seizure, in the event that defendants violate terms of\ninjunction prohibiting further infringement). Other Districts have issued similar orders as preliminary relief in a\nvariety of contexts. See, e.g., Chanel v. Liu Ling, No. 10-cv-489 (E.D. Va. Oct. 7, 2010) (Temporary Restraining\nOrder, at Dkt. 14) (ex parte order transferring counterfeiters’ domain names to account in trust for the Court and\nredirecting domain to copy of complaint); Microsoft v. Does, No. 13-cv-139 (E.D. Va. Jan. 31, 2013) (Temporary\nRestraining Order, at Dkt. 23) (ex parte order disabling CFAA defendants’ domain names). .\n24\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 6 Filed 06/11/15 Page 31 of 38\nnames. The All Writs Act provides that a court may issue any writ necessary or appropriate to\neffectuate the administration of justice. 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a). This power extends to the issuance\nof writs directed to third-parties when necessary to implement a court order. United States v.\nNew York Tel. Co., 434 U.S. 159, 174 (1977) (“The power conferred by the Act extends, under\nappropriate circumstances, to persons who, though not parties to the original action or engaged in\nwrongdoing, are in a position to frustrate the implementation of a court order or the proper\nadministration of justice and encompasses even those who have not taken any affirmative action\nto hinder justice.”) (internal citations omitted).\nThe top-level domain registries, as custodians of the .org and .info top-level\ndomains, have the ability to remove the association between the Defendants’ domain names and\nthe Defendants’ IP addresses. The top-level domain registries for the .org and .info top-level\ndomains have offices in the United States and are subject to this Court’s jurisdiction.\nFurthermore, the Public Interest Registry has informed Plaintiffs that it will comply with a Court\norder directing it to disable Defendants’ domain names.77\nFinally, requiring that the top-level domain registries disable Defendants’ domain\nnames will not implicate Due Process concerns by imposing any substantial burden on the\nregistries because changing the IP address associated with a domain name (or, similarly,\n77 DeMarco Decl. ¶ 6. As noted above, Defendants have used overseas domain registration service providers who\nconceal Defendants’ true identities. These providers may not respect U.S. court orders. Fundacion Private Whois,\nused by the Defendants to register sci-hub.org and bookfi.org, states that it will only comply with an order to compel\nthe disclosure of personal information upon receipt of “a final judgment from a competent court of the Republic of\nPanama instructing us to do so.” See Fundacion Private Whois Terms and Conditions, at www.privatewhois.net\n(retrieved April 13, 2015). Whois Privacy Corp., used by Defendants to register libgen.org, elibgen.org, libgen.info,\nand estrorecollege.org, states that it “may in its discretion, abide by court orders” issuing from any jurisdiction. See\nWhois Privacy Service Agreement, ¶ 5.c, at www.whoisprivacycorp.com/agreement (retrieved April 13, 2015)\n(emphasis added).\n25\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 6 Filed 06/11/15 Page 32 of 38\ndisabling the association between a domain name and an IP address) is a regular business\npractice of the top-level domain registries.78\nB. Plaintiffs Should Be Permitted to Serve Defendants by E-mail\nElsevier respectfully requests that the Court approve and order alternate means of\nservice on Defendants via e-mail. Specifically, Elsevier has located e-mail addresses provided\nby some of the Defendants on their websites.79 Elsevier also requests that service be permitted\nthrough the e-mail addresses listed as the “Registrant Email” in the WHOIS records for the\nDefendants’ websites. Notice and service by the foregoing means satisfy Due Process, are\nappropriate, sufficient, and reasonable to apprise Defendants of this action, and are necessary\nunder the circumstances. Moreover, should this Court authorize service by e-mail, Elsevier will,\nso as to ensure the provision of comprehensible notice to those Defendants who may be Russian-\nspeaking, serve all Defendants copies of the Complaint, Summons, and all motions or proposed\norders in both English and Russian.80\nFirst, legal notice and service by e-mail satisfies Due Process as it is reasonably\ncalculated, in light of the circumstances, to apprise the interested parties of the temporary\nrestraining order, preliminary injunction hearing, and lawsuit. See Mullane v. Central Hanover\nBank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950). Such methods are also authorized under Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 4(f)(3), which allows a party to serve defendants by any means not\nprohibited by international agreement, as the Court directs. As this Court stated in Philip Morris\nUSA Inc. v. Veles Ltd.:\n78 DeMarco Decl. ¶ 8.\n79 Woltermann Decl. ¶ 61.\n80 DeMarco Decl. ¶ 13.\n26\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 6 Filed 06/11/15 Page 33 of 38\nBy design, Rule 4(f)(3) was adopted in order to provide flexibility\nand discretion to the federal courts in dealing with questions of\nalternative methods of service of process in foreign countries . . . .\nWhat constitutes appropriate service will vary depending upon the\nparticular circumstances of the case. Under Rule 4(f), courts have\npermitted a wide range of alternative methods including email . . . .\nIn each case, the court must determine whether the alternative\nmethod is reasonably calculated, under all circumstances, to\napprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford\nthem an opportunity to present their objections.\nPhilip Morris USA Inc. v. Veles Ltd., No. 06-cv-2988, 2007 WL 725412, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar.\n12, 2007) (internal citations and quotations omitted). See also United States v. Lebanese\nCanadian Bank, 285 F.R.D. 262, 266 (S.D.N.Y.2012) (“The decision of whether to order service\nof process under Rule 4(f)(3) is committed to the sound discretion of the district court.”)\n(quotations omitted)); In re S.

Moreover,\n“‘[S]ervice of process under Rule 4(f)(3) is neither a ‘last resort’ nor ‘extraordinary relief.’ It is\nmerely one means among several which enables service of process on an international\ndefendant.’” Ehrenfeld v. Salim a Bin Mahfouz, No. 04 CIV. 9641, 2005 WL 696769, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 23, 2005) (quoting Rio Properties, Inc. v. Rio Int’l.

Mar. 16, 2009).\nIndeed, the methods of notice and service proposed by Elsevier have been\napproved in numerous cases, including in the Second Circuit, and particularly in cases such as\nthis, involving Internet-based misconduct, carried out by international defendants, and causing\nimmediate, irreparable harm. As the Ninth Circuit observed:\n[Defendant] had neither an office nor a door; it had only a\ncomputer terminal. If any method of communication is reasonably\ncalculated to provide [Defendant] with notice, surely it is e-mail-\nthe method of communication which [Defendant] utilizes and\nprefers. In addition, e-mail was the only court-ordered method of\nservice aimed directly and instantly at [Defendant] . . . . Indeed,\nwhen faced with an international e-business scofflaw, playing\nhide-and-seek with the federal court, e-mail may be the only means\nof effecting service of process.\nRio Properties, Inc., 284 F.3d at 1014-15.81 See, e.g., Philip Morris USA Inc., 2007 WL 725412,\nat *3 (citing Rio Properties and authorizing e-mail and fax as alternate means of service where\n“defendants conduct business extensively, if not exclusively, through their Internet websites and\ncorrespond regularly with customers via email.

See Nat’l Equip. Rental, Ltd. V.\nSzukhent, 375 U.S. 311 (1964) (“And it is settled . . . that parties to a contract may agree in\nadvance to submit to the jurisdiction of a given court, to permit notice to be served by the\nopposing party, or even to waive notice altogether.”).

(“WPC”, used by Defendants to\nregisterlibgen.org, elibgen.org, libgen.info, and estrorecollege.org) – state in their terms that they\nare to be contacted by e-mail only, and that they agree to forward such e-mail correspondence to\ndomain owners. See Fundacion Terms and Conditions, available at www.privatewhois.net\n(“Fundacion Private Whois is immediately and without any filtering or human intervention\nforwarding all emails sent to the listed public Whois contact to your chosen email addresse(s) . . .\nFundacion Private Whois will simply discard or reject all physical mail we may receive on your\nbehalf.”); see also WPC Contact Us page, available at www.whoisprivacycorp.com (“If you\n82 The specific e-mail addresses to be served for each Defendant are listed in Elsevier’s proposed order.\n30\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 6 Filed 06/11/15 Page 37 of 38\nneed to contact an owner please send an email to the email address you found in the public\nwhois.”). 83\nFinally, even were we to assume that certain Doe Defendants were physically\nlocated in Russia, it bears noting that although the United States and Russia are both signatories\nto the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extra-Judicial Documents in\nCivil and Commercial Matters (the “Hague Convention”), Article 1 of the Hague Convention\nspecifically states that “[the] convention shall not apply where address of the person to be served\nwith the document is not known.” See Prediction Co.

Mar. 22, 2010) (Hague Convention inapplicable although country\nat issue, India, was a signatory, because Defendant’s address was unknown to Plaintiff). As the\naddresses of the Defendants here, with the exception of Defendant Elbakyan, are unknown, the\nHague Convention does not apply in this case either.84 With respect to Defendant Elbakyan,\nElsevier has been able to locate a physical address for this Defendant in Almaty, Kazakhstan.\nWhile Elsevier intends to, with the Court’s approval, also serve Elbakyan via e-mail, it will of\ncourse also attempt service by postal mail at this physical address.\nElsevier’s counsel has researched whether the issuance of the requested service\norder pursuant to Rule 4(f)(3) is contrary to or likely to offend the laws of Kazakhstan.85 The\nlaws of Kazakhstan do not appear to prohibit the service of process by e-mail or by postal mail\n83 DeMarco Decl. ¶ 12.\n84 It also bears noting that, though it does not expressly authorize e-mail service, the Hague Convention does not\npreclude e-mail service, and thus, is no bar to court-directed e-mail service under Rule 4(f)(3).

Elsevier, a publisher who owns the copyrights to certain academic journals and\noperates the proprietary Internet-based subscription database “ScienceDirect,” through which\nauthorized users may access such academic journals, seeks leave of Court to serve limited,\nimmediate discovery on a third party service provider to determine the true identities of the Doe\nDefendants, who are being sued for copyright infringement and violations of the Computer Fraud\nand Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1030.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 66 Filed 09/13/16 Page 2 of 3\n2. As alleged in the Complaint, the Doe Defendants, without authorization, operate\nseveral websites through which they distribute Elsevier’s copyrighted works. In addition, also as\nalleged in the Complaint, the Doe Defendants obtain copies of Elsevier’s copyrighted works by,\nwithout authorization, accessing ScienceDirect and using such access to download those works\ntherefrom.\n3. Elsevier does not know the true names of the Doe Defendants because the Doe\nDefendants registered the domain names for the websites they use to distribute Elsevier’s\ncopyrighted works using third-party anonymization services.\n4. Elsevier intends to serve Rule 45 subpoenas on CloudFlare, Inc., a third-party\nservice provider whose services the Doe Defendants have used to mask the location of the\ncomputer servers upon which their websites are hosted. Specifically, Elsevier seeks, through\nRule 45 subpoenas, documents that identify, among other things, the IP address of such\ncomputer servers and any identifying information the Doe Defendants provided to CloudFlare in\nthe course of their use of CloudFlare’s services. Without this information, Elsevier cannot\nidentify the Doe Defendants or pursue its lawsuit to protect its copyrighted works from repeated\ninfringement.\n5. Good cause exists to allow Elsevier to conduct this limited discovery in advance\nof a Rule 26(f) conference where the Defendants are unknown and are therefore unavailable for\nsuch a conference.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 66 Filed 09/13/16 Page 3 of 3\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff applies for an Order permitting Elsevier to conduct the\nforegoing discovery on an expedited basis.\nDated: New York, New York\nSeptember 14, 2016\nRespectfully submitted,\nDEVORE & DEMARCO LLP\nBy: _/s/ Joseph V.

(together “Plaintiffs” or\n“Elsevier”) respectfully submit this memorandum of law in support of their Application for\nLeave to Take Expedited Discovery.\nI. Introduction\nAs the Court is aware from proceedings to date, Elsevier is a world leading\nprovider of professional information solutions in the Science, Medical, and Health sectors.\nElsevier distributes its scientific journal articles and book chapters electronically via its\nproprietary subscription database “ScienceDirect.” As set forth in the Complaint, the\nDeclarations of Joseph V. DeMarco and Paul F. Doda, and the exhibits thereto, certain unknown\nindividuals have effected a scheme to pirate Elsevier’s copyrighted scientific works by\ndistributing those works, without authorization, on the Internet.\n1\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 67 Filed 09/13/16 Page 2 of 13\nOn October 28, 2015, this Court granted Plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary\ninjunction against Defendants.1 The Order specifically restrained the Defendants from “unlawful\naccess to, use, reproduction, and/or distribution of Elsevier’s copyrighted works and from\nassisting any other person or business entity in engaging in” such activities.2\nPlaintiffs now seek expedited discovery to identify and locate the Defendants.\nBecause most of these individuals have taken great steps in executing their unlawful scheme to\nconceal their true identities, Elsevier has been unable to identify and name them in its Complaint\nin this action. Instead, as the Court knows, Elsevier has named “John Does 1-99.” Elsevier\ntherefore seeks leave from the Court to conduct expedited discovery for the limited purpose of\nsufficiently identifying these individuals so as to be able to name and serve them as Defendants.\nSpecifically, Elsevier seeks to obtain the IP addresses at which two of the Defendants’ websites\nare located as well as the names, addresses, and contact information, concerning the operators of\nthose websites from a third-party Internet service provider. Elsevier seeks this information for\nthe limited purposes of identifying the Defendants in this action and identifying any service\nproviders who host Defendants’ websites that are covered by the Order so that Elsevier may\nprovide to those service providers copies of this Court’s Orders.\nII. Background\nA. Elsevier’s ScienceDirect Platform\nElsevier is a world leading provider of professional information solutions in the\nScience, Medical, and Health sectors.3 Elsevier publishes, markets, sells, and licenses academic\n1 (Dkt. 53, hereinafter the “Order”).\n2 Order at 16.\n3 Declaration of Paul F. Doda (Doda Decl.) ¶ 2.\n2\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 67 Filed 09/13/16 Page 3 of 13\ntextbooks, journals, and examinations in the fields of science, medicine, and health.4 Elsevier\ndistributes its scientific journal articles and book chapters electronically via its proprietary\nsubscription database “ScienceDirect” (www.sciencedirect.com).5 In most cases, Elsevier holds\nthe copyright and/or exclusive distribution rights to the works available through ScienceDirect.6\nB. The Library Genesis Project and Its Mirrors\nThe Library Genesis Project operates the website “libgen.org,” at which it hosts a\nmassive repository of infringing content, together with a specialized search engine which allows\nits users to locate and download copies of pirated content.7 Elsevier has investigated the Library\nGenesis Project and has verified that it does, in fact, make an array of Elsevier’s copyrighted\nworks available for download, at no cost and without Elsevier’s permission.8 The Library\nGenesis Project claims to host approximately 1 million scientific and technical books, as well as\n40 million scientific journal articles.9 In addition to the libgen.org website, the Library Genesis\nProject’s repository, or a substantial portion thereof, is or has been accessible through a number\nof “mirror” websites, including “bookfi.org.”10 Although following this Court’s Order of\nOctober 28, 2015, libgen.org no longer functions as a mirror site to the Library Genesis Project,\nit does currently redirect to “golibgen.io,” which does operate as such a mirror.11\nC. Proceedings to Date\nAs noted above, Elsevier commenced this action by filing a Complaint on June 3,\n2015, against a number of websites and their operators who have engaged in a sophisticated\n4 Id.\n5 Id. ¶ 5.\n6 Id. ¶ 6.\n7 Id. ¶¶ 7-8.\n8 Declaration of Anthony Woltermann (Dkt. 8) ¶ 21.\n9 Id. ¶¶ 19-20.\n10 Doda Dec. ¶ 12.\n11 Id. ¶ 10.\n3\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 67 Filed 09/13/16 Page 4 of 13\nscheme to pirate millions of copyrighted scientific works.12 With the exception of a single\nwebsite Defendant, the identity of the operators of the Defendant websites were unknown to\nElsevier, and those operators were therefore named as “John Doe” Defendants.13\nOn June 11, 2015, Elsevier moved for a preliminary injunction barring the\nDefendants from continuing their infringing activities and ordering that certain third party\nservice providers – specifically those who had provided anonymization services for Defendants’\nregistration of their domain names – provide records concerning the identity of the operators or\nregistrants of those domain names upon Elsevier’s request.14\nOn October 28, 2015, this Court granted Elsevier’s motion for a preliminary\ninjunction.15 In so doing, this Court ordered that “Upon the Plaintiff’s request, those\norganizations which have registered Defendants’ domain names on behalf of Defendants shall\ndisclose immediately to the Plaintiffs all information in their possession concerning the identity\nof the operator or registrant of such domain names.”16 Among the Defendants subject to that\norder were both the Library Genesis Project (the operator of the Libgen.org website) and\nBookfi.org.17\nD. Elsevier’s Attempts to Learn the Identity of the Operators of Libgen.org\nand Bookfi.org\nSince substantially before the filing of the present action and continuing to the\npresent, Elsevier has used the resources at its disposal in an attempt to learn the true identity of\n12 Complaint (Dkt. 1).\n13 Id.\n14 Application for an Order Authorizing Alternate Service of Process on Defendants and Order to Show Cause\nfor Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. 5).\n15 Opinion (Dkt. 53).\n16 Id. at 16.\n17 Id. at 2.\n4\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 67 Filed 09/13/16 Page 5 of 13\nthe operators of the Defendant websites, including of Libgen.org and Bookfi.org. For many\nwebsites, contact information for the operator of the website can be found in publicly-available\nWHOIS records, which provide the name, physical address, and mailing address of the website\noperator, along with the IP address and location of the server from which the website is hosted.18\nIn the case of Libgen.org and Bookfi.org, as described below, the information found in publicly-\navailable WHOIS records did not include either the true identity or contact information of the\nwebsites’ operators or the true location of the servers upon which those sites were hosted.19\ni. Defendants’ Use of Domain Registration Anonymization Services\nFor a number of reasons, a website operator may not wish that his or her name\nand contact information be included in publicly-available WHOIS records. In order to serve the\nneeds of such individuals, an industry of domain registration anonymization services has arisen.\nThese services register the domain names of their customers as those customers’ proxies. As a\nresult, the WHOIS records for sites registered using these services list the anonymization service,\nrather than the site operator, as the registrant.20\nAt all times since Elsevier has been aware of Defendants’ websites, the operators\nof both Libgen.org and Bookfi.org have used domain registration anonymization services to\nmask their true identities, preventing Elsevier from identifying Defendants from that source.21\nElsevier has also attempted to locate information concerning the true identities of the operators\nof Libgen.org and Bookfi.org through searches of historical domain name registration records,\nbut no identifying information could be found.22\n18 Declaration of Joseph V. DeMarco, (DeMarco Decl.) ¶ 4.\n19 Doda Decl. ¶ 13.\n20 DeMarco Decl. ¶ 5.\n21 Doda Decl. ¶ 19.\n22 DeMarco Decl. ¶ 6.\n5\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 67 Filed 09/13/16 Page 6 of 13\nFollowing this Court’s Order, Elsevier, through its counsel, requested that Whois\nPrivacy Corp. – the domain registration anonymization service used by both Libgen.org and\nBookfi.org – provide records concerning the identities of the registrants of those websites.23\nWhois Privacy Corp., however, has been entirely unresponsive to these requests, and has\nprovided no information of any kind to Plaintiffs.24\nii. Defendants’ Use of CloudFlare to Mask the Location of the\nServers Where Their Websites are Hosted\nElsevier has also sought to learn the identity of the operator of Defendants’\nwebsites by identifying the entities that provide the actual computer servers upon which\nDefendants’ websites are hosted. Once identified, these hosting companies could potentially be\nserved subpoenas requiring them to disclose information in their possession concerning the\nDefendants who are their customers. In the case of Libgen.org and Bookfi.org, however, this\navenue for discovery is similarly blocked by the use of content delivery and optimization\nservices provided by CloudFlare.25\nCloudFlare allows websites to route their traffic – both to and from the website’s\nserver – through CloudFlare’s globally-distributed network of endpoints.26 This process\nprovides users of CloudFlare’s services both performance and security advantages.27 A\ncollateral consequence of the use of CloudFlares’ services, as configured, is that the publicly-\naccessible WHOIS records for a website which uses CloudFlare’s network as a “middle man” in\n23 Id. ¶ 7.\n24 Id. ¶ 8. Whois Privacy Corp. appears to be located outside of the United States, and likely outside this\nCourt’s jurisdiction.\n25 Doda Decl. ¶¶ 11, 13, 17.\n26 Id. ¶ 14.\n27 Id.\n6\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 67 Filed 09/13/16 Page 7 of 13\nthis manner will show CloudFlare as the “host” of the website, rather than the server which truly\nhouses the content.28\nPrior to the issuance of the Preliminary Injunction in this action, both Libgen.org\nand Bookfi.org were routed through CloudFlare’s network, preventing Elsevier from learning the\ntrue IP address and server location of those sites.29 CloudFlare, however, would have to have\nbeen provided with certain information concerning the Defendants’ websites in order to provide\nits service. At minimum, Defendants’ use of CloudFlare would have required Defendants to\nprovide CloudFlare with the IP address of the true host of each website, so that CloudFlare could\nappropriately route Internet traffic to and from those websites.30 Beyond that, CloudFlare may\nhave contact information, payment information, or other transactional information from which\nthe Defendants may be identified.31\nPlaintiffs’ efforts to obtain identifying information concerning libgen.org and\nbookfi.org from CloudFlare have thus far been fruitless. Specifically, Elsevier has attempted to\nobtain the IP address of the computer servers upon which Defendants’ websites were hosted\nthrough CloudFlare’s “Trusted Reporter” program. The Trusted Reporter program allows certain\nrights holders and monitoring vendors to obtain host IP addresses for websites which infringe\nintellectual property rights.32 Elsevier participates in the Trusted Reporter program through the\nvendor Digimarc, which acts as Elsevier’s agent for the Trusted Reporter program.33 Through\nDigimarc, Elsevier has attempted to use the Trusted Reporter program to learn the host IP\naddresses for Libgen.org and Bookfi.org. However, Elsevier has been unable to obtain this\n28 See, e.g., Id. ¶¶ 11, 13.\n29 Id.\n30 Id. ¶ 16.\n31 Id.\n32 Id. ¶ 21.\n33 Id.\n7\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 67 Filed 09/13/16 Page 8 of 13\ninformation because CloudFlare does not provide host IP addresses for sites which are no longer\nactive on CloudFlare’s network.34 This policy prevented Elsevier from using the Trusted\nReporter program to obtain host IP information because, pursuant to this Court’s Order, both\nLibgen.org and Bookfi.org had been rendered non-operational.35 As a result, Elsevier is unable\nto obtain historical information concerning the operators of Libgen.org and Bookfi.org from\nCloudFlare through the Trusted Reporter program.\nE. Expedited Discovery Is Necessary\nAs described above, the Defendants have taken numerous steps to conceal their\nidentities. In addition, although Elsevier has served copies of all the pleadings, motions, letters,\nand orders in this matter upon all the Defendants as specified in this Court’s Order,36 neither the\noperators of Libgen.org nor Bookfi.org have appeared in this action or responded to Elsevier or\nits counsel in any manner whatsoever.37 Moreover, despite the issuance of the Preliminary\nInjunction in this action barring the Defendants from continuing their infringing activity, most, if\nnot all, of the Defendants have continued their unlawful scheme by relocating their pirate\nwebsites to new domains.38 Given this pattern of avoidance, Elsevier has no reason to believe\nthat any Defendant will appear at the pretrial conference scheduled for October 24, 2016, at an\ninitial discovery conference, or indeed at any other part of this action, thus frustrating the\npurpose of those proceedings. As a result, in order to advance this action towards resolution, and\nto enforce the terms of the Preliminary Injunction, it is critical that Elsevier expediently obtain\nidentifying information concerning the operators of the Defendant websites.\n34 Id. ¶ 22.\n35 Id.\n36 Dkt. 15 (permitting service by email upon Defendants).\n37 DeMarco Decl. ¶ 9.\n38 Id. ¶ 10.\n8\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 67 Filed 09/13/16 Page 9 of 13\nIII. Argument\nOrdinarily, parties to a federal civil lawsuit may not take discovery before the\ninitial discovery conference. Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 26(d)(1), (f). However, courts, including courts in\nthis District, will permit parties to conduct expedited discovery in advance of a Rule 26(f)\nconference where the moving party demonstrates that it has “good cause” for its request and the\nrequest is “reasonable” in light of the circumstances. Ayash v. Bank Al-Madina, 233 F.R.D. 325,\n327 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (noting that modern courts apply a “flexible ‘good cause’ test” in ruling on\nrequests for expedited discovery) (citations omitted); see also Malibu Media, LLC v. John Doe\nSubscriber Assigned IP Address 173.68.5.86, 2016 WL 2894919 at *2, No. 16-cv-2462 (S.D.N.Y.\nMay 16, 2016) (“it is implicit [in Rule 26(d)] that some showing of good cause should be made to\njustify such an order, and courts presented with requests for immediate discovery have frequently\ntreated the question whether to authorize early discovery as governed by a good cause standard.”)\n(quoting 8A Charls Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2046.1\n(3d ed. 2011)). Courts in this district have specifically permitted expedited discovery when a\nPlaintiff who has established a meritorious claim would otherwise have no ability to enforce that\nclaim. See, e.g., Digital Sin, Inc. v. Does 1-176, 279 F.R.D. 239, 241-42 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (finding\ngood cause to issue a Rule 45 subpoena to ISP when the defendants could not otherwise be\nidentified); Admarketplace, Inc. v. Tee Support, Inc., 2013 WL 4838854 at *2, No. 13-cv-5635\n(S.D.N.Y. Sept. 11, 2013).\nIn the Second Circuit, five principal factors are considered when determining\nwhether expedited discovery is appropriate: “(1) [the] concrete[ness of the plaintiff's] showing of\na prima facie claim of actionable harm, ... (2) [the] specificity of the discovery request, ... (3) the\nabsence of alternative means to obtain the subpoenaed information, ... (4) [the] need for the\n9\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 67 Filed 09/13/16 Page 10 of 13\nsubpoenaed information to advance the claim, ... and (5) the [objecting] party's expectation of\nprivacy.” Arista Records, LLC v. Doe 3, 604 F.3d 110, 119 (2d. Cir. 2010) (quoting Sony Music\nEntertainment Inc. v. Does 1-40, 326 F. Supp.2d 556 (S.D.N.Y. 2004).\nApplying these factors, this Court should grant Elsevier’s application for limited,\nexpedited third-party discovery in the form of the proposed subpoena attached to the Declaration\nof Joseph V. DeMarco as Exhibit B.\nA. Elseiver Has Established a Prima Facie Claim of Actionable Harm\nAs demonstrated above and during the course of the proceedings in this action, the\nJohn Doe defendants have conducted and continue to conduct a piracy scheme on a massive scale.\nThis Court has previously addressed this factor in its Order granting a preliminary injunction\nagainst the Defendants, finding that “Elsevier has made a substantial evidentiary showing …\n[that] demonstrates a likelihood of success on Elsevier’s copyright infringement claims.” Order\n(Dkt. 53) at 6-7. In addition, this Court also found that irreparable harm, sufficient to support a\npreliminary injunction was present because the harm Defendants have caused to Elsevier is\nunlikely to be effectively quantifiable and any monetary damages “would dramatically exceed\nDefendants’ ability to pay.” Id. at 9-10.\nB. Elsevier’s Discovery Request is Narrowly Tailored to Seek Only Specific\nInformation Concerning the Defendants\nElsevier is not seeking a broad mandate from the Court to conduct wide-ranging\ndiscovery. Rather, Elsevier’s application is a narrowly-tailored request, directed at a single\nservice provider, and limited only to documents which may assist Elsevier in determining the\nidentity and location of the John Doe defendants. The application does not seek any evidence that\ngoes to the merits of Elsevier’s claims or that may inform an inquiry as to the magnitude of\n10\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 67 Filed 09/13/16 Page 11 of 13\ndamages, each of which would be more appropriate following the Rule 26(f) conference. Elsevier\nsimply wants to know who the Doe Defendants are and has framed its request for discovery to\ndetermine that.\nC. Elsevier Lacks an Alternative Reasonable Means by Which to Obtain\nIdentifying Information Concerning the Defendants\nAs described above, Elsevier has used all of the tools at its disposal in its attempt\nto identify the operators of Libgen.org and Bookfi.org. However, as a consequence of the\nDefendants’ use of various service providers to anonymize their identities, as well as the non-\nresponsiveness of those service providers to Elsevier’s requests to date, these efforts have thus far\nbeen fruitless. The domain registration anonymization services have failed to provide information\npursuant to this Court’s Order, and CloudFlare has not provided information through the\nestablished “Trusted Reporter” program. As a result, Elsevier has exhausted all other reasonable\noptions and now must now seek this Court’s intervention in order to obtain identifying\ninformation concerning John Doe Defendants, or at least information which would allow it to\nidentify the hosting provider those defendants use, from CloudFlare: a business which has had\ndirect dealings with both Libgen.org and Bookfi.org.\nD. Absent Identifying Information Concerning the Defendants, Elsevier Will\nBe Unable to Advance Its Claims\nAlthough this action has been ongoing for more than a year, and the Defendants\nhave been enjoined from further infringing conduct for more than ten months, the Defendants\nhave thus far failed to appear and, with the exception of the operator of Sci-Hub.org, failed to\ncommunicate with Elsevier, its counsel, or this Court in any manner. Rather, they have simply\nignored these proceedings and adapted their infringing scheme to evade this Court’s Order.\n11\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 67 Filed 09/13/16 Page 12 of 13\nElsevier does not expect that any of the Defendants will participate in any pre-trial conference,\nrendering any such conference useless. Further, absent the ability to identify and locate the\noperators of Libgen.org and Bookfi.org, even if Elsevier succeeds in its claim, it will have no\nability to enforce any judgment it obtains against them.\nE. Elsevier’s Interest in Advancing its Claim Supersedes Defendants’\nExpectation of Privacy\nAs demonstrated by this Court’s Order requiring Defendants’ domain registration\nanonymization providers to disclose their identities, the balance of interests between Elsevier’s\nright to protect its intellectual property rights and Defendants’ right to remain anonymous tips\nsquarely in Elsevier’s favor. As this Court reasoned, Elsevier “continues to suffer irreparable\nharm due to the Defendants’ making its copyrighted material available for free.”39 Conversely,\nDefendants’ privacy rights, if any, arise from their “right” to distribute infringing materials on the\nInternet anonymously. However, such a right does not exist, as the First Amendment right to\nspeak anonymously does not extend to unlawful activity such as that engaged in by the\nDefendants, because copyright infringement is not protected speech. Sony Music Entertainment,\nInc. v. Does 1-40, 326 F. Supp.2d 556, 564 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (“a person who engages in P2P file\nsharing is not engaging in true expression. Such an individual is not seeking to communicate a\nthought or convey an idea. Instead, the individual’s real purpose is to obtain music for free.”\n(internal citations omitted)). Accordingly, the First Amendment does not protect the right of file\nsharers to proceed anonymously. Id.\n39 Order at 11.\n12\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 67 Filed 09/13/16 Page 13 of 13\nIV. Conclusion\nIn sum, Elsevier cannot wait for the Rule 26(f) conference to begin conducting\ndiscovery, because without knowing the true identities of the Doe Defendants, Elsevier cannot\neffectively proceed against the operators of Libgen.org and Bookfi.org, and that conference\ncannot take place. Without expedited discovery, Elsevier will be stuck in an indefinite\n“holding pattern,” unable to enforce its rights in court.\nFor the reasons set forth above and in the accompanying declarations, it is\nrespectfully submitted that Plaintiff’s Application for Leave to Take Expedited Discovery be\ngranted.\nDated: New York, New York\nSeptember 14, 2016\nRespectfully submitted,\nDEVORE & DEMARCO LLP\nBy: /s/ Joseph V.

DEMARCO IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’\nAPPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO TAKE EXPEDITED DISCOVERY\nI, JOSEPH V. DEMARCO, declare as follows is true and correct:\n1. I submit this declaration in support of Plaintiffs’ Application for Leave to Take\nExpedited Discovery from CloudFlare, Inc. regarding the identity of the Defendants who\noperated the websites Bookfi.org and Libgen.org.\n2. I am a member of the Bar of this Court and a partner of the law firm of DeVore &\nDeMarco LLP, attorneys for plaintiffs Elsevier Inc., Elsevier B.V., and Elsevier Ltd. (together\nthe “Plaintiffs” or “Elsevier”) in this above-referenced matter. My office address is 99 Park\nAvenue, Suite 1100, New York, New York, 10016.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 68 Filed 09/13/16 Page 2 of 3\n3. Plaintiffs’ application is directed toward obtaining discovery concerning the\nidentity of John Doe Defendants from CloudFlare, Inc., a third-party service provider whose\nservices have been used by the unknown operators of www.libgen.org and www.bookfi.org.\n4. In the course of investigating a website in the context of civil or criminal\nproceedings, it is a routine practice to use publicly-accessible WHOIS records to learn the\nidentity of the operator of a website, contact information for that operator, and the IP address and\nlocation of the server upon which the website is hosted.\n5. When domain names are registered using anonymization services, however, the\npublicly-accessible WHOIS records will reflect the identity and contact information of the\nanonymization service, rather than that of the website’s operator.\n6. During the course of our investigation into the activities libgen.org and\nbookfi.org, we have, in addition to searching publicly-available WHOIS records, also consulted\nproprietary sources of historical domain name registration information. These searches have not\nrevealed the identity of the operators of bookfi.org or libgen.org.\n7. Pursuant to this Court’s Order of October 28, 2015, we requested that Whois\nPrivacy Corp., the domain registration anonymization service used by both bookfi.org and\nlibgen.org, provide us with information sufficient to identify those websites’ operators. A copy\nof that request, dated November 18, 2015, is attached hereto as Exhibit A.\n8. Whois Privacy Corp. has neither provided the requested information nor\nresponded to our request in any manner whatsoever.\n9. The operators of libgen.org and bookfi.org have neither appeared in this action\nnor contacted Elsevier or my firm.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 68 Filed 09/13/16 Page 3 of 3\n10. Since shortly following the entry of the preliminary injunction in this case on\nOctober 28, 2015, we have not observed any website configured at the domains libgen.org or\nbookfi.org. We have, however, discovered several new mirror sites operated by the Defendants\nin this action, including golibgen.io, which is currently accessible through an automatic re-direct\nto any user who attempts to visit www.libgen.org.\n11. Attached hereto as Exhibit B is a proposed subpoena in substantially the form as\nPlaintiffs intend to issue should this Court grant Plaintiff leave to do so.\nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.\nDated: New York, New York\nSeptember 14, 2016\nRespectfully submitted,\nDEVORE & DEMARCO LLP\nBy: /s/ Joseph V.

Elsevier’s ScienceDirect Platform\n4. Elsevier is the world’s leading publisher of peer-reviewed scholarly journals.\nElsevier currently publishes more than 2,500 scholarly journals and approximately 365,000\narticles annually in those journals. Elsevier is also a leading publisher of scholarly books,\npublishing approximately 33,000 books. Elsevier’s scholarly journals include world-renowned\npublications such as The Lancet and Cell.\n5. Elsevier operates “ScienceDirect,” an online platform through which users can\naccess the contents of Elsevier-published scientific, technical, engineering, and medical journals\nand book chapters. As of March 30, 2015, the ScienceDirect platform contains approximately\n12.3 million scientific journal articles and 33,000 books.\n6. Elsevier owns the copyrights in a substantial portion of the materials it makes\navailable through ScienceDirect. In addition, Elsevier is the exclusive licensee of the copyrights\nin a majority of the works on ScienceDirect in which it does not own the copyright.\nB. Defendants’ Unlawful Distribution of Elsevier Content\n7. The Library Genesis Project is an illegal online repository of copyrighted works,\nincluding scientific articles and book chapters illegally obtained from the ScienceDirect\nplatform. At the time of the commencement of this action, the Library Genesis Project\nmaintained websites reachable at a number of Internet addresses, including at the URL\n“libgen.org.”\n8. The Library Genesis Project claims to store and distribute millions of copyrighted\nscientific works, including a great number of Elsevier’s copyrighted works, to its users at no\ncost. To my knowledge, the Library Genesis Project is one of the largest, if not the single\n2\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 69 Filed 09/13/16 Page 3 of 7\nlargest, repository of pirated copies of Elsevier’s (and other publishers’) copyrighted scientific\nworks on the Internet.\n9. Elsevier has not at any time authorized the Library Genesis Project to distribute\nany of Elsevier’s copyrighted works through any channel, including through the libgen.org\nwebsite.\n10. As of the time of this Declaration, the libgen.org URL redirects to golibgen.io,\nwhich appears to be a mirror of at least a substantial portion of the Library Genesis Project\nrepository. The golibgen.io homepage bears a copyright notice of “© 2010 Libgen”, where the\nword “Libgen” is a hyperlink to gen.lib.rus.ec, which is the current location of the main Library\nGenesis Project website. A true and correct screenshot of the golibgen.io homepage, retrieved\non September 8, 2016, is attached hereto as Exhibit A.\n11. Following this Court’s Order, dated October 28, 2015, granting Elsevier’s motion\nfor a preliminary injunction against Defendants, the Libgen.org domain was temporarily\ninaccessible. WHOIS records retrieved on August 15, 2015 indicate that at that time, Libgen.org\nused CloudFlare’s services to mask the location of its servers. A true and correct copy of\nWHOIS records for Libgen.org, retrieved August 15, 2015, is attached hereto as Exhibit B.\n12. In addition to the Libgen.org URL, the Library Genesis Project repository is\nmaintained or accessed through a number of “mirror” websites. Among these “mirror” sites is\nBookfi.org. At the time of the commencement of this action, Bookfi.org provided access to a\nsubstantial portion of the Library Genesis Project repository, including to pirated copies of\nElsevier’s copyrighted scientific works.\n3\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 69 Filed 09/13/16 Page 4 of 7\n13. Following this Court’s Order, dated October 28, 2015, granting Elsevier’s motion\nfor a preliminary injunction against Defendants, the Bookfi.org domain became inaccessible and\nhas remained so to the date of this Declaration. WHOIS records retrieved on August 15, 2015\nindicate that at that time, Bookfi.org used CloudFlare’s services to mask the location of its\nservers. A true and correct copy of WHOIS records for Bookfi.org, retrieved August 15, 2015, is\nattached hereto as Exhibit C.\nC. Defendants’ Use of CloudFlare’s Services to Mask Their Location and Identity\n14. CloudFlare provides a number of services to the operators of websites to increase\nperformance and provide security. Among those services is one that routes traffic to and from a\nCloudFlare client’s website through CloudFlare’s globally-distributed network. This process has\nseveral advantages for CloudFlare’s clients. Among those advantages is that a malicious actor\nseeking to attack a CloudFlare client’s website will only be able to determine the location of\nCloudFlare’s server, and can therefore not directly attack the client’s server. A true and correct\ncopy of an excerpt from CloudFlare’s description of this process, entitled “Step 1: How does\nCloudFlare work?”, and accessible at https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-\nus/articles/205177068-Step-1-How-does-CloudFlare-work-, is attached hereto as Exhibit D.\n15. In addition to providing performance benefits and security to legitimate websites,\nCloudFlare’s services can be exploited by unlawful websites to avoid identification of the\nlocation of their servers and the identity of their operators. Publicly-available WHOIS records\ndo not indicate the true location of the website’s server or the entity which provides that server\n(who could then be the subject of a discovery request). Rather, the only information accessible\nto the public is that the website is being routed through a CloudFlare server.\n4\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 69 Filed 09/13/16 Page 5 of 7\n16. CloudFlare requires its clients to provide certain information in order to use its\nservices. Specifically, in order for CloudFlare to connect a website to its network delivery\nsystem, a client must provide CloudFlare the IP address of the server whose traffic will be routed\nthrough the network. In addition, CloudFlare may have identifying and/or billing information\nconcerning the client.\n17. Both Libgen.org and Bookfi.org have, as described above, used CloudFlare’s\nservices. Elsevier therefore strongly believes that CloudFlare has in its possession information\nthat either identifies the operators of the Libgen.org and Bookfi.org websites or that will assist\nElsevier in its efforts to identify those operators.\nD. Elsevier’s Efforts to Learn the Identity of the John Doe Operators of Libgen.org\nand Bookfi.org\n18. In the current action, the operators of Libgen.org and Bookfi.org are named as\n“John Doe” defendants because Elsevier has been unable to determine the true identity of the\noperators of those sites, or even the true location of the servers upon which those sites are hosted.\nThis is because the John Doe Defendants have used varied means, including the use of\nCloudFlare’s services, to anonymize their location, to mask their true identities.\n19. At all times since Elsevier became aware of the infringing activities of Libgen.org\nand Bookfi.org, those sites’ domain names have been registered through anonymization services\nthat effectively mask the identities of the true owners of the domain names. Through counsel,\nand pursuant to this Court’s Order of October 28, 2015, Elsevier has attempted to obtain\nidentifying information concerning the owners of the domain names. To date, Elsevier has not\nreceived any response to those requests.\n5\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 69 Filed 09/13/16 Page 6 of 7\n20. Elsevier’s anti-piracy efforts include engaging Digimarc Corporation to, among\nother functions, obtain information from certain Internet service providers when needed to\nenforce Elsevier’s intellectual property rights.\n21. Through its “Trusted Reporter Program,” CloudFlare agrees to provide host IP\naddresses for websites which infringe the intellectual property rights of certain rights holders,\nincluding Elsevier, and to specific monitoring vendors, including Elsevier’s vendor Digimarc.\n22. Elsevier has attempted to use the mechanism described in paragraphs 20 and 21\nabove by requesting that Digimarc obtain host IP addresses for the Libgen.org and Bookfi.org\ndomains from CloudFlare. However, when Digimarc attempted to request this information,\nCloudFlare’s system rejected the requests because they related to domains that were not at the\ntime active on CloudFlare’s network. A true and correct copy of the error message received by\nDigimarc upon the attempted request for information concerning Libgen.org, generated on\nSeptember 8, 2016, is attached hereto as Exhibit E.\n23. As a result of the circumstances described above, Elsevier has been unable to\nlearn the true identity or location of the operators of the Libgen.org and Bookfi.org domains, and\ncan therefore not name such individuals as defendants in this action.\n6\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 69 Filed 09/13/16 Page 7 of 7",

DEMARCO IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’\nAPPLICATION FOR AN ORDER AUTHORIZING ALTERNATIVE SERVICE OF\nPROCESS ON DEFENDANTS AND ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE FOR A\nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION\nI, JOSEPH V. DEMARCO, declare as follows is true and correct:\n1. I submit this affidavit in support of Plaintiffs’ application for an order authorizing\nalternative service of process on defendants and entry of a preliminary injunction.\n2. I am a member of the Bar of this Court and a partner of the law firm of DeVore &\nDeMarco LLP, attorneys for plaintiffs Elsevier Inc., Elsevier B.V., and Elsevier Ltd. (together\nthe “Plaintiffs” or “Elsevier”) in this above-referenced matter. My office address is 99 Park\nAvenue, Suite 1100, New York, New York, 10016.\n3. Plaintiffs’ application is directed toward Defendants’ websites within the “.org”\nand “.info” top-level domains. These top-level domains are maintained by organizations which\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 7 Filed 06/11/15 Page 2 of 4\nmaintain physical offices in the United States. Specifically, the Public Interest Registry, which is\nthe top-level domain registry for “.org” domains, is located in Reston, Virginia, while Afilias\nPlc, which is the top-level domain registry for “.info” domain maintains an office in Horsham,\nPennsylvania.\n4. The “.org” top-level domain was initially created for non-profit organizations, and\ncontinues to commonly be associated with public interest and non-profit websites.\n5. In the course of my representation of Elsevier, I have brought the unlawful\nactivities of defendant Sci-Hub to the attention of the Public Interest Registry. Specifically, on\nbehalf of Elsevier, I requested that the Public Interest Registry remove www.sci-hub.org from\nactive registration because, among other things, the site’s actions violated the Public Interest\nRegistry’s Terms of Use.\n6. Through its counsel, the Public Interest Registry informed me that it does not\ndisable domains absent a valid court order, but would promptly comply with a valid court order\nto disable a domain.\n7. According to WHOIS records, many of Defendants’ websites are physically\nhosted by organizations in Russia, which, in my experience, are unlikely to honor orders issued\nfrom a U.S. court authorizing the seizure of Defendants’ servers located there. Moreover,\nDefendants have used non-U.S. privacy protection services which I do not believe will respect\nsimilar orders.\n8. Requiring that the top-level domain registrars disable Defendants’ domain names\nwill not implicate Due Process concerns by imposing any substantial burden on the registrars\nbecause changing the IP address associated with a domain name (or, similarly, disabling the\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 7 Filed 06/11/15 Page 3 of 4\nassociation between a domain name and an IP address) is a regular business practice of the top-\nlevel domain registrars.\n9. Through the use of Google’s “Webmaster Tools,” a domain registrant can use the\n“Change of Address” tool to redirect search traffic from one URL to another. Using this tool,\nDefendants would be unable to frustrate an order disabling their domain names by transitioning\ntheir content to new domains and informing Google to redirect search traffic for the disabled\ndomain to a newly-registered domain.\n10. Should this Court determine that it is required to do so, Elsevier is prepared to\npost a bond pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 65(c) so as to secure a preliminary injunction against\nDefendants’ conduct.\n11. Elsevier’s counsel and I have consulted with counsel in Kazakhstan and have\nbeen advised that the laws of Kazakhstan do not appear to prohibit the service of process by e-\nmail or by postal mail from the United States.\n12. Defendants have registered their websites using proxy registrants – Fundacion\nPrivate Whois and Whois Privacy Corp. – who anonymize the websites’ true owners and which\nrequire as part of their user agreements, that all correspondence directed to those owners be sent\nto an email listed in public WHOIS records. Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a true and correct\ncopy of Fundacion Private Whois’ Terms and Conditions. Attached hereto as Exhibit B is a true\nand correct copy Whois Privacy Corp’s “Contact Us” page.\n13. Should this Court authorize service by e-mail, Elsevier will, so as to ensure the\nprovision of comprehensible notice to those Defendants who may be Russian-speaking, serve all\nDefendants copies of the Complaint, Summons, and all motions or proposed orders in both\nEnglish and Russian.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 7 Filed 06/11/15 Page 4 of 4\nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.",

Elsevier's application for leave to take expedited discovery is narrowly\ntailored to obtain identifying information concerning the operators of libgen.org and bookfi.org.\n4. There is good cause to believe that absent identifying information\nconcerning the operators of libgen.org and bookfi.org, Elsevier will be unable to advance its\nclaims against those operators.\nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Plaintiffs' Application for Leave to Take\nExpedited Discovery from CloudFlare, Inc. concerning the identities of the operators of the\nwebsites libgen.org and bookfi.org is GRANTED. Plaintiff may serve a third party subpoena\non CloudFlare, Inc. requiring production of records relating to the identities of the operators of\nlibgen.org and bookfi.org.\nDated: New York, New York\nOctobef21.._, 2016",

HIRSCHBERG\nI, David M. Hirschberg, declare as follows:\n1. I am a member of the Bar of this Court and am associated with the law firm of\nDeVore & DeMarco LLP, attorneys for plaintiffs Elsevier Inc., Elsevier B.V., and Elsevier Ltd.\n(together the “Plaintiffs” or “Elsevier”) in this above-referenced matter. My office address is 99\nPark Avenue, Suite 1100, New York, New York, 10016. I am familiar with the facts and\ncircumstances in this action.\n2. I submit this declaration pursuant to Rule 55.1 of the Civil Rules for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, in support of Plaintiffs’ application for a Certificate of Default.\n3. Upon information and belief, none of the defendants in this action are infants,\nincompetents, or members of the United States military. The only individual defendant whose\nidentity is known to Plaintiffs at this time is Alexandra Elbakyan, who, upon information and\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 79 Filed 02/16/17 Page 2 of 3\nbelief, is a 28-year old graduate student who is a resident of either Russia or Kazakhstan. All\nother individual defendants in this action are the unknown operators of websites which have\ntrafficked in pirated copies of articles published in scientific journals.\n4. All defendants in this action were served with copies of the Complaint, the\nCourt’s Order dated June 18, 2015, notice of the Preliminary Injunction Hearing, and the Civil\nSummons issued by the Clerk of Court, along with Russian language translations of each of\nthose documents, in the manner provided for by this Court’s Order dated June 18, 2015, during\nthe period beginning June 23, 2015 and ending June 30, 2015. Attached hereto as Exhibits A\nthrough G are affidavits of service which have been filed with this Court (Dkts. 24 through 30).\n5. As directed by the Court’s Order, service on Defendant Alexandra Elbakyan was\nattempted by mail to Zhumabaeva, 172, Almaty, Kazakhstan 050014 (Dkt. 25). The materials\nmailed to that address, however, were returned unopened. My firm requested information from\nthe United States Postal Service as to the status of the mailed materials, and was informed that\nthe postal service of Kazakhstan was unable deliver the parcel as addressed. Attached as Exhibit\nH is a true and correct copy of the response to our inquiry and a photograph of the parcel\ndisplaying the article number.\n6. Although Elbakyan did not receive the mailed copies of the initiating documents\nin this case by postal mail, she apparently did receive them by email, a fact evidenced by her\nparticipation in two teleconferences with the Court on July 7 and July 14, 2015, and her letter to\nthe Court, filed September 15, 2015, in which she expressly references the litigation by case\nnumber (Dkt. 50).\n7. Defendant Alexandra Elbakyan has failed to plead or otherwise defend this action.\nElbakyan participated in two teleconferences with the Court and Platintiffs’ counsel on July 7\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 79 Filed 02/16/17 Page 3 of 3",

(“Elsevier”).\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 8 Filed 06/11/15 Page 2 of 18\nA. Elsevier’s ScienceDirect Platform\n4. Elsevier B.V. owns and operates ScienceDirect: a subscription database\naccessible at www.sciencedirect.com. A true and correct screenshot of the ScienceDirect\nhomepage is attached hereto as Exhibit A.\n5. Through ScienceDirect, Elsevier provides its subscribers access to its database of\nscientific journal articles and book chapters. In most cases, the copyright in the content available\nthrough ScienceDirect is owned by Elsevier B.V., Elsevier Inc., or Elsevier Ltd. ScienceDirect\nusers may purchase individual journal articles or book chapters through ScienceDirect for prices\ntypically ranging from $19.95 to $41.95 for journal articles and $31.50 for most book chapters.\n6. Educational institutions, and specifically research universities, are significant\nsubscribers to ScienceDirect. Through their institutional subscriptions, universities are able to\nprovide their students and faculty access to ScienceDirect.\n7. Among the institutional subscribers to ScienceDirect are Columbia University,\nFordham University, and New York University, each of which is physically located, and\nmaintains computer networks, in the Southern District of New York.\n8. The content available through ScienceDirect – i.e., scientific journal articles and\nbook chapters – is physically housed on servers operated by Akamai Technologies, Inc. Akamai\nis a cloud service provider with data centers and “edge servers” located throughout the world,\nincluding at least one data center in the Southern District of New York.\n9. Akamai operates a proprietary distributed cache network known as the “Akamai\nIntelligent Platform.” This process serves cached copies of content maintained in the Akamai\ncloud, including Elsevier’s copyrighted material in ScienceDirect, by way of particular Akamai\nedge servers that are geographically close to the user. A user that accesses copyrighted works in\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 8 Filed 06/11/15 Page 3 of 18\nScienceDirect from a university located in the Southern District of New York will likely receive\ncontent that originates from Akamai’s edge servers also located in the Southern District of New\nYork.\nB. Remote Access to ScienceDirect\n10. To best serve the usage needs of its community of scholars and researchers,\nincluding their need to access information remotely (for example, while traveling, on sabbatical\nor otherwise off-campus), Elsevier provides university students and faculty remote access to\nScienceDirect authenticated through their university systems. In effect, this means that Elsevier\nallows university students and faculty to access ScienceDirect by authenticating access via\ncredentials issued by their university, rather than with ScienceDirect.\n11. Educational users may authenticate their computers’ access to ScienceDirect and\nobtain an authorization token when connected to a subscribing university’s computer network.\nAn authorization token is an encrypted “cookie,” issued by ScienceDirect and stored on the\nuser’s computer.\nOnce the authorization token has expired,\nthe user will have to re-authenticate his access in order to obtain a new authentication token.\n12. When a user’s request for access originates within the IP address range of an\nauthorized university licensee (i.e., on the university’s computer network), ScienceDirect will\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 8 Filed 06/11/15 Page 4 of 18\nperform authentication based on that university IP address and subsequently issue an\nauthorization token to the user.\n13. Remote users can typically access ScienceDirect in two manners. In the first of\nthese methods, a university will operate a “proxy” service which allows students and faculty\nmembers to use university-provided access credentials to log into the university’s computer\nnetwork from a remote location. In effect, when a remote computer is connected to a university\ncomputer network through a proxy service, that computer is for all intents and purposes part of\nthat network. A critical consequence of this practice is that from the perspective of a third-party\nInternet-based service like ScienceDirect, the remote computer will appear to be located at the IP\naddress of the university operating the proxy service. For example, if a student at Columbia\nUniversity is on vacation in France and accesses the Columbia computer network through a\nproxy service, when that student then visits an Internet-based service such as ScienceDirect, his\nlocation (as determined by IP Address) will appear to be Columbia University and its IP address,\nrather than France. A figure detailing this connection method is attached hereto as Exhibit B.\n14. In the second method, the remote user connects to a university network (either on-\nsite or remotely through a proxy) in order to obtain an authorization token. Once the\nauthorization token is obtained, the user can connect directly to ScienceDirect from any location,\nincluding those outside the university computer network. Notably, unlike in the proxy\nconnection method, a remote user who connects to ScienceDirect in this manner will not pass his\nbrowsing activity on ScienceDirect through a university computer system. A figure detailing this\nconnection method is attached hereto as Exhibit C.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 8 Filed 06/11/15 Page 5 of 18\nC. The Library Genesis Project\n15. The Library Genesis Project is an illegal online repository of copyrighted works,\nincluding scientific articles and book chapters legally available on the ScienceDirect platform.\nThe Library Genesis Project maintains a website at the URL “libgen.org,” and an alternative\ndomain at “libgen.in.” A true and correct screenshot of the Library Genesis Project’s home page,\nas retrieved April 2, 2015, is attached hereto as Exhibit D.\n16. I have personally reviewed the content of the Library Genesis Project’s website as\npart of Elsevier’s ongoing efforts to prevent the ongoing infringement of the copyrights in\nscientific journal articles and book chapters accessible through ScienceDirect. To my\nknowledge, the Library Genesis Project is the single largest repository of pirated scientific\ncontent Elsevier has ever encountered.\n17. As of April 2, 2015, the URL libgen.org directs to a server with the IP address\n93.174.95.71. This IP address is assigned to Ecatel Ltd., in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. A true\nand correct copy of the WHOIS record for libgen.org, retrieved April 2, 2015, is attached hereto\nas Exhibit E.\n18. The Library Genesis Project’s home page contains a search box with options to\nsearch by keyword, Title, Author, Series, Periodical, Publisher, Year, ISBN, and other fields.\nUsers may also opt to search different types of materials, including “LibGen (Sci-Tech)” and\n“Scientific articles.”\n19. “LibGen (Sci-Tech),” which refers to scientific and technical books, is the default\nsetting for a search on libgen.org. Above the search box is displayed the text “Library Genesis”\nfollowed by the superscript “1M.” I believe that the superscript “1M” indicates that the “LibGen\n(Sci-Tech)” repository contains approximately 1 million pirated books.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 8 Filed 06/11/15 Page 6 of 18\n20. If a user clicks on “Scientific articles” on the libgen.org home page, he is directed\nto “libgen.org/scimag,” a search page which permits users to search by Digital Object Identifier\n(“DOI”), PubMed ID,1 or Author and Article. A user may also search by journal title, ISSN,\nVolume or Year of Publication, Issue Number, and Page Number. Above the search box is\ndisplayed the text “Library Genesis: Scientific Articles” followed by the superscript “40M.” I\nbelieve that the superscript “38M” indicates that the Library Genesis Project’s repository\ncontains approximately 40 million pirated scientific articles. A true and correct screenshot of the\nweb page “libgen.org/scimag,” retrieved June 10, 2015, is attached hereto as Exhibit F.\n21. The Library Genesis Project’s repository appears to contain a substantial majority\nof all of the scientific journal articles Elsevier publishes and makes available through\nScienceDirect. In the course of my investigation of the libgen.org website, I found it difficult to\nlocate a ScienceDirect-hosted article which was not illegally available through the Library\nGenesis Project’s repository.\n22. In order to facilitate the creation of “mirrors” of the libgen.org website which\nperpetrate and extend the volume and availability of the millions of pirated articles available on\nthe site, the Library Genesis Project allows users to download search databases containing\nbibliographic information concerning the works in the Library Genesis Project repository. On or\nabout March 17, 2015, Elsevier downloaded copies of the “LibGen (Sci-Tech)” and “Library\nGenesis: Scientific Articles” databases. I and other Elsevier officials then analyzed these\ndatabases to determine how many Elsevier-published works are contained in the Library Genesis\nProject repository.\n1 Digital Object Identifiers and PubMed IDs are unique identification codes which specify a particular\npublication.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 8 Filed 06/11/15 Page 7 of 18\n23. Elsevier’s analysis of the “LibGen (Sci-Tech)” bibliographic database indicates\nthat the Library Genesis Project repository contains more than 29,000 Elsevier imprint book\ntitles. Elsevier’s analysis of the “Library Genesis; Scientific Articles” database indicates that the\nLibrary Genesis Project repository contains approximately 12 million articles associated with\nElsevier branding. Attached hereto as Exhibit G is a table detailing Elsevier’s analysis of the\nElsevier-published works contained in the Library Genesis Project bibliographic database.\n24. Based on my review of a sampling of these search results, a substantial number, if\nnot nearly all, of the Elsevier-published books and journal articles contained in the Library\nGenesis Project repository are Elsevier’s copyrighted works. Elsevier has not authorized the\nLibrary Genesis Project to distribute any of Elsevier’s works.\n25. The bibliographic database of scientific journal articles also contains data\nconcerning the date upon which each document was added to the Library Genesis Project\nrepository. From this data, I have been able to determine the rate at which new articles are added\nto the repository. Based on my analysis of this ingestion rate over a recent one month span, the\nLibrary Genesis Project obtains an average of approximately 3,500 new Elsevier-published\nscientific articles each day. Attached hereto as Exhibit H is a table showing the number of new\narticles added to the Library Genesis Project’s “Scientific Articles” repository each day for the\nperiod beginning January 21, 2015, and ending February 20, 2015.\n26. Notably, below the search box on the Library Genesis Project’s scientific articles\npage is the statement “if file not found – redirect to sci-hub.org.” To test this connection, I\nsearched for “xxxxxxx” (gibberish text intended to yield no results in the Library Genesis Project\nrepository) and was redirected to Sci-Hub’s proxied Google Scholar search results (as discussed\nbelow, paragraph 40) for that text. The webpage displaying results in response to the search for\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 8 Filed 06/11/15 Page 8 of 18\n“xxxxxxx” was “scholar.google.com.sci-hub.org.” A true and correct screenshot of this page is\nattached hereto as Exhibit I.\n27. Libgen.org encourages its users to contribute pirated works to the Library Genesis\nProject repository. Through links accessible through the “Upload” dropdown on its main page,\nthe Library Genesis Project provides instructions to its users on how to upload content to the\nrepository by FTP or through dedicated online tools such as “Libgen Uploader” and “Sci Articles\nUploader.” Each of these tools requires a password distributed through the Library Genesis\nProject’s dedicated online forum at genofond.org. A true and correct screenshot of these\ninstructions is attached hereto as Exhibit J.\n28. I am aware that The Library Genesis Project derives revenue from its infringing\nactivities through donations, which it accepts via BitCoin.\n29. Based on my review of the Library Genesis Project’s website, I believe that the\nProject is dedicated substantially, if not nearly exclusively, to the piracy of copyrighted works.\n30. In addition to the Library Genesis Project domains discussed above, a number of\nwebsites hosted at other domains appear to mirror the functionality of libgen.org. Among these\n“mirror” sites are “elibgen.org,” “libgen.info,” and “lib.estrorecollege.org.” These URLs\nredirect to freescienceengineering.library.elibgen.org, which provides substantially identical\nfunctionality as does the “LibGen (Sci-Tech)” repository on libgen.org, including the ability to\nsearch for and download pirated scientific books. True and correct screenshots of the\nfreescienceengineering.library.elibgen.org home page, retrieved April 2, 2015, and June 10,\n2015, are attached hereto as Exhibit K. The site “bookfi.org” also appears to duplicate the\nfunction of the “LibGen (Sci-Tech)” repository, including the ability to search for and download\npirated scientific books. In some cases, the Library Genesis Project encourages its users to visit\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 8 Filed 06/11/15 Page 9 of 18\nthese mirror sites. A true and correct screenshot showing links from libgen.org to such mirror\nsites is attached hereto as Exhibit L.\n31. As of April 2, 2015, the URL elibgen.org directs to a server with the IP address\n46.32.68.138. This IP address is assigned to AS Information Network, LLC., in Saint\nPetersburg, Russia. A true and correct copy of the WHOIS record for elibgen.org, retrieved\nApril 2, 2015, is attached hereto as Exhibit M.\n32. As of April 2, 2015, the URL libgen.info directs to a server with the IP address\n46.32.68.138. This IP address is assigned to AS Information Network, LLC., in Saint\nPetersburg, Russia. A true and correct copy of the WHOIS record for libgen.info, retrieved April\n2, 2015, is attached hereto as Exhibit N.\n33. A true and correct copy of the WHOIS record for estrorecollege.org, retrieved\nApril 2, 2015, is attached hereto as Exhibit O.\n34. As noted above, a visitor to elibgen.org, libgen.info, or lib.estrorecollege.org is\nredirected to “freescienceengineering.library.elibgen.org,” (at the IP address 46.32.68.138)\nwhich previously explicitly stated its connection to the Library Genesis Project. Specifically, the\nelibgen.org site displays, on its home page, the text “You are in the Library Genesis 1M online\nlibrary.” It is unclear whether the elibgen.org website or the other websites which redirect to it\nare operated by the Library Genesis Project or by other unknown Doe Defendants acting in\nconcert with the Library Genesis Project.\n35. A true and correct copy of the bookfi.org homepage, retrieved April 10, 2015, is\nattached hereto as Exhibit P.\n36. As of April 14, 2015, the URL bookfi.org directs to a server with the IP address\n104.28.12.85. This IP address is assigned to Cloudflare, Inc. in Phoenix, Arizona. A true and\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 8 Filed 06/11/15 Page 10 of 18\ncorrect copy of the WHOIS record for Bookfi.org, retrieved June 10, 2015, is attached hereto as\nExhibit Q.\nD. Sci-Hub’s Infringing Activities\n37. When Elsevier became aware of the website Sci-Hub.org, which appeared to\nenable its users illegal access to millions of scientific articles provided by multiple journal\nservices, including ScienceDirect, Elsevier began an investigation into Sci-Hub. The\ninvestigation was extraordinarily difficult because, like many illegal internet operations, the\nDefendants go to great lengths to conceal from the publishers (and law enforcement) details\nabout their activities to procure copyrighted content, their locations, and the technical means by\nwhich they carry out their schemes. Among other techniques, Sci-Hub has periodically blocked\naccess to its website from IP addresses associated with the United States and the Netherlands:\ntwo countries with which Elsevier is closely associated.\n38. I have personally reviewed the content of the Sci-Hub website as part of\nElsevier’s ongoing efforts to prevent Sci-Hub’s ongoing infringement of the copyrights in\nscientific journal articles and book chapters accessible through ScienceDirect.\n39. As of April 2, 2015, the URL sci-hub.org directs to a server with the IP address\n31.184.194.81. This IP address is assigned to Petersburg Internet Network Ltd., in Saint\nPetersburg, Russia. A true and correct copy of the WHOIS record for Sci-Hub.org, retrieved\nApril 2, 2015, is attached hereto as Exhibit R.\n40. The Sci-Hub home page contains a search box which allows users to search for\nscientific publications based on a number of criteria, including keywords, Digital Object\nIdentifier, PubMed Identifier, and source URL. A true and correct screenshot of the Sci-Hub\nhome page, retrieved April 2, 2015, is attached hereto as Exhibit S.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 8 Filed 06/11/15 Page 11 of 18\n41. When a user performs a keyword search on Sci-Hub, the website returns a proxied\nversion of search results for the entered keywords from the Google Scholar search database. 2\nThe URL of these proxied results is scholar.google.com.sci-hub.org. A true and correct\nscreenshot of the results from a sample keyword search result, performed April 2, 2015, is\nattached hereto as Exhibit T.\n42. When a user selects a ScienceDirect-hosted search result from the proxied Google\nScholar results, Sci-Hub will provide the user access to the requested article. Specifically, Sci-\nHub will redirect the user to a proxied version of ScienceDirect. Because this connection is\nmade either through an authorized university’s network or using a misappropriated authorization\ntoken, the user will be presented a link through which he may download the requested content in\nPDF or HTML format at no charge. A true and correct screenshot of a proxied ScienceDirect\npage is attached hereto as Exhibit U.\n43. Outside the illegal Sci-Hub scheme, when an unauthenticated guest user visits the\nScienceDirect website and accesses this page, the “download PDF” link shown in the proxied\nversion of the ScienceDirect page (as depicted in Exhibit S) instead provides a link allowing the\nuser to purchase the requested article. A true and correct copy of the ScienceDirect page for the\narticle requested in Exhibit U, as seen by an unauthenticated user, is attached hereto as Exhibit\nV.\n44. If, instead of searching for an article by keyword, a Sci-Hub user searches for an\nElsevier-published, ScienceDirect-hosted content using a unique identifier (e.g., Digital Object\nIdentifier), the user is redirected directly either to a Library Genesis Project-hosted copy of the\n2 Google Scholar is a search engine operated by Google and accessible at scholar.google.com, which\nprovides its users the ability to search for research articles, legal cases, and patents. In the case of scientific journal\narticles, Google Scholar does not ordinarily host the content of the articles, but rather displays only bibliographic\ninformation and provides a link to a website where the article may be purchased or viewed.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 8 Filed 06/11/15 Page 12 of 18\nrequested content, if the requested content is already present in the Library Genesis Project’s\nrepository, or, if not, to a proxied version of the ScienceDirect page for the content, as described\nabove in paragraph 40.\n45. I believe that when a Sci-Hub user requests ScienceDirect-hosted content which is\nnot already stored in the Library Genesis Project’s repository, Sci-Hub uploads a copy of the\nrequested content to the Library Genesis repository. Sci-Hub, on its Twitter account, explained\nthe use of the Library Genesis Project repository in this manner, stating that “All downloaded\narticles are saved on LibGen and downloaded from there after the second request.” A true and\ncorrect copy of Sci-Hub’s February 14, 2013, Twitter posting is attached as Exhibit B to the\nDeclaration of David M. Hirschberg, along with a translation of that post.\n46. Based on my review of the Sci-Hub website and the information set forth above, I\nbelieve that Sci-Hub serves no other purpose than to facilitate the systematic and rampant\ninfringement of copyrighted content belonging to Elsevier and other scientific publishers.\n47. As is the case with the Library Genesis Project, Sci-Hub appears to derive\nrevenue from its infringing activities through user donations. The Sci-Hub “donations” page,\naccessible at sci-hub.org/donate permits users to donate to the site via credit card, QIWI, and\nYandex card2card. A true and correct screenshot of the donations page, retrieved April 1, 2015,\nalong with a translated version of that page, are attached as Exhibit A to the Declaration of David\nM. Hirschberg.\n48. The Sci-Hub donations page also demonstrates the immediacy of the threat Sci-\nHub and the Library Genesis Project present to Elsevier and other scientific publishers. I have\nreviewed a translation of the donations page, which, in explaining why the amount of donations\nrequired to run the Sci-Hub website will be lower in the future, states:\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 8 Filed 06/11/15 Page 13 of 18\nIt is important to know that these costs will not be recurrent, for\ntwo reasons: the first one - additions of articles to the library has\nbeen very active (during the last two months, 3.5 million new\narticles were added, the frequency of loading continuing to rise) -\nwhich means that in the future, there will no longer be any need to\ndownload most articles through the proxy, but simply from the\nlibrary. The second reason is that we have been developing our\ntechnology which will allow us to operate without a proxy.3\nIf those statements are to be believed, Sci-Hub is pirating scientific journal articles at a rate of\napproximately 58,000 articles per day, which is equivalent to one article approximately every\none and a half seconds. In addition, because these pirated articles are being archived to the\nLibrary Genesis Project’s repository, as time goes by, a greater and greater percentage of\nScienceDirect’s (and all other major scientific publishers’) entire corpus of journal articles will\nhave been pirated and transferred to the Library Genesis Project.\n49. Elsevier has undertaken substantial effort in its attempts to curtail Sci-Hub’s\ninfringing activities. From the time Elsevier learned of Sci-Hub’s existence through\napproximately March, 2014, Sci-Hub’s access to ScienceDirect was accomplished largely, if not\nentirely, through university proxy servers.\n50. During the pre-March, 2014 period, I and other Elsevier officials seeking to\naddress this problem examined ScienceDirect access logs in an effort to determine the source of\nSci-Hub’s intrusions. As a result of these examinations, I was able to identify numerous source\nIP addresses associated with university computing systems that were likely sources of infringing\naccess. On many occasions, I provided this information to university information technology\ndepartments, including those in Manhattan, which were able to identify the compromised student\naccounts and take steps to prevent further use of those accounts’ credentials. However, due to\nthe number of universities victimized by Sci-Hub and those universities’ differing levels of\n3 See supra, paragraph 45.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 8 Filed 06/11/15 Page 14 of 18\nexpertise and responsiveness, Elsevier’s efforts have been largely ineffective in preventing Sci-\nHub’s continued intrusions.\n51. I am aware that Sci-Hub apparently obtained students’ access credentials, at least\nin some circumstances, by offering payment for those credentials. According to statements\nposted to Sci-Hub’s “donate” page at or around this time, several PayPal payments were sent for\nthe purpose of “Buying a university proxy.” A true and correct screenshot of Sci-Hub’s “donate”\npage, retrieved on or about June 17, 2013, is attached hereto as Exhibit W.\n52. By approximately March, 2014, through their identification and disabling of\ncompromised student accounts, Elsevier and its subscriber universities had succeeded in vastly\nreducing Sci-Hub’s use of university proxies to pirate ScienceDirect content. Sci-Hub, on its\nTwitter account, expressed its frustration with these efforts, stating “Due to the huge amount of\naccounts that were closed recently we were forced to introduce limits on the maximum number\nof users, especially foreigners.” A true and correct screenshot of this Twitter post, dated March\n22, 2013, along with a translation, is attached as Exhibit C to the Declaration of David M.\nHirschberg.\n53. In response to Elsevier’s efforts to reduce Sci-Hub’s piracy, Sci-Hub adapted its\nmethods. Beginning in or about March, 2014, rather than connect to ScienceDirect through a\nuniversity proxy, Sci-Hub instead began using university proxies only to obtain an authorization\ntoken, which it subsequently used to connect to ScienceDirect from a different source IP address.\nThis method of obtaining unauthorized access to ScienceDirect is much more difficult to\ninvestigate and, to date, Elsevier has been unable to effectively combat Sci-Hub’s new vector of\nattack.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 8 Filed 06/11/15 Page 15 of 18\nE. Sci-Hub and the Library Genesis Project Work in Concert to Infringe the\nCopyrights of Elsevier and Other Scientific Publishers\n54. As noted above in paragraph 43, Sci-Hub apparently stores user-requested\nscientific journal articles in the Library Genesis Project’s repository and retrieves those articles\nfrom the Library Genesis Project if they are subsequently requested.\n55. Based on the description of Sci-Hub’s activities on its donations page, Sci-Hub\nrelies on the Library Genesis Project’s repository as a source of infringing content and intends to\ndo so to a greater degree in the future.\n56. As noted above in paragraph 26, the Library Genesis Project redirects requests for\nscientific journal articles it does not already possess in its repository to Sci-Hub’s search and\nretrieval system. In this way, the Library Genesis Project relies on Sci-Hub as a means of\nobtaining new pirated scientific content.\n57. Libgen.org’s “Scientific Articles” web page contains a prominent and direct link\nto Sci-Hub in the menu bar at the top of the page.\nF. Sci-Hub’s Intrusion into University Computing Systems Poses a Significant Risk to\nStudents, Universities, and the Public\n58. In addition to the harm suffered by Elsevier and other publishers as the result of\nSci-Hub’s and the Library Genesis Project’s infringing activities, the unauthorized intrusion into\nuniversity computing systems through compromised student credentials has the potential to\ncause serious injury to the universities, students, and the public.\n59. While many universities’ ScienceDirect subscriptions are unlimited in nature (i.e.,\nthe university pays a flat fee for access to ScienceDirect rather than pay on a per-article basis),\nsome universities have a “draw down” account. In this scenario, the university pays for a fixed\ndollar amount or number of articles which may be accessed by its students and staff. When this\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 8 Filed 06/11/15 Page 16 of 18\nthreshold is met, the university must pay additional sums in order to continue its access. When\nan unauthorized entity – such as Sci-Hub – uses such a university’s subscription, it depletes the\nfunds on deposit and potentially deprives legitimate users of their university’s paid-for access\nand requires that the university purchase addition access.\n60. Unauthorized access to university systems also poses a number of significant risks\nentirely separate from those relating to scientific databases. Criminals often use access to\ncompromised systems to facilitate hacking activities, attacks on third-party systems, and the\ndistribution of malware or botnets. In addition, university systems often contain sensitive and\npersonal information concerning the students whose credentials have been compromised. Access\nto this type of information is often used by malicious actors to engage in identity theft or other\nwrongdoing.\nG. Contact Email Addresses of Defendants\n61. Elsevier is unaware of the true names or locations of the Doe Defendants.\nElsevier has, however, in the course of its investigation discovered email addresses posted by\nDefendants on their websites at which Elsevier believes Defendants may be reached. These\ninclude:\n• For Sci-Hub.org – support@sci-hub.org and sci.hub.org@gmail.com;\n• For Alexandra Elbakyan – mindwrapper@gmail.com.\nTrue and correct screenshots linking Defendants to support@sci-hub.org and\nmindwrapper@gmail.com are attached hereto as Exhibit X. Sci-Hub’s use of the\nsci.hub.org@gmail.com email address is demonstrated in Exhibit W.\n62. For elibgen.org, libgen.info, and estrorecollege.org, each of which re-directs to\nfreescienceengineering.org, Elsevier has located an email address for those sites at\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 8 Filed 06/11/15 Page 17 of 18\ninfo.freescienceengineering.org/index.html. Specifically, the “EMAIL” links on that page direct\nto the address libgeninfo@yandex.com. A true and correct screenshot of this page is attached\nhereto as Exhibit Y.\n63. Each of the Defendants’ websites has been registered using a privacy protection\nservice which anonymizes the true owner of the site by acting as a registration proxy. These\nservices, in turn, provide a unique, anonymous email address for each site owner and submit that\nemail address to the appropriate registrar for inclusion in WHOIS records. Email\ncorrespondence sent to these email addresses is typically forwarded to the sites’ true operators.\n64. According to publicly-available WHOIS records, the operators of the Defendant\nwebsites can be reached through their privacy protection service-provided email addresses at:\n• For Sci-Hub.org: 522ab14bo3mfc7dy@5225b4d0pi3627q9.privatewhois.net\n(See Exhibit Q.);\n• For Libgen.org:\n54a8a84ays7z9z21@5225b4d0pi3627q9.whoisprivacycorp.com (See Exhibit\nE.);\n• For Elibgen.org:\n54ca64605o1goil9@5225b4d0pi3627q9.whoisprivacycorp.com (See Exhibit\nM.);\n• For Libgen.info:\n54ada35fyv9gp5gt@5225b4d0pi3627q9.whoisprivacycorp.com (See Exhibit\nN.);\n• For Estrorecollege.org:\n54a19036ejtinug6@5225b4d0pi3627q9.whoisprivacycorp.com (See Exhibit\nO.); and\n• For Bookfi.org: 52e4d617f98mrf0y@5225b4d0pi3627q9.privatewhois.net\n(See Exhibit P.)\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 8 Filed 06/11/15 Page 18 of 18",

(collectively\n“Elsevier” or “Plaintiffs”) commenced this action with a Complaint seeking damages and\ninjunctive relief against Sci-Hub and its operator Alexandra Elbakyan and (collectively the “Sci-\nHub Defendants”) and The Library Genesis Project and its operators (collectively the “LibGen\nDefendants”). On June 11, 2015, Plaintiffs moved the Court for an Order to Show Cause for a\nPreliminary Injunction, which this Court granted on June 18, 2015. On July 1, 2015, Plaintiffs\nfiled Affidavits of Service attesting to service on all Defendants.\nThe Defendants, having been served with the Complaint, Order to Show Cause, and\nrelated papers, did not appear or oppose Plaintiffs’ application for a Preliminary Injunction. On\nOctober 30, 2015, this Court granted Plaintiffs’ application and entered a Preliminary Injunction\nagainst all Defendants.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 81-1 Filed 05/16/17 Page 2 of 4\nNo Defendant has appeared following the entry of the Preliminary Injunction or answered\nthe Complaint. The time for answering the Complaint has expired.\nOn May 16, 2017, Plaintiffs moved the Court for an Order to Show Cause for a final\nDefault Judgment and for a Permanent Injunction. Having reviewed the Complaint, Motion for\nDefault Judgement, and all related pleadings, declarations, and other materials submitted to this\nCourt, Plaintiffs have demonstrated that:\n1. Defendants have been properly served with the Summons and Complaint;\n2. To the best of Elsevier’s knowledge, Defendants are not infants,\nincompetent, or in the military services of the United States;\n3. Because Defendants have not filed an Answer or otherwise defended this\naction, the Clerk of Court entered a default against all Defendants on February 16, 2017;\n4. Elsevier is the owner of numerous valid and enforceable federally-\nregistered copyrights in various books and journal articles in the fields of science, medicine, and\nhealth, including the works described in Exhibit A (collectively the “Copyrighted Works”);\n5. Defendants have infringed Elsevier’s copyrights in the Copyrighted Works\nby reproducing and distributing the Copyrighted Works through their websites, which include or\nhave included those listed in Exhibit B; and\n6. Defendants Alexandra Elbakyan, Sci-Hub, The Library Genesis Project,\nand Bookfi.org, have each disregarded the Preliminary Injunction in this action by continuing to\ninfringe Elsevier’s copyrights in the Copyrighted Works.\nTHIS COURT HEREBY FINDS that Defendants are liable for willful copyright infringement\nunder 17 U.S.C. §§ 101, et. seq., and this Default Judgment and Permanent Injunction\n(“Permanent Injunction”) is entered against each Defendant.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 81-1 Filed 05/16/17 Page 3 of 4\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:\n1. Defendants, their officers, directors, principals, agents, servants, employees, successors\nand assigns, and all persons and entities acting in active concert or participation with\nthem, are hereby permanently enjoined and restrained from unlawful access to, use,\nreproduction, and/or distribution of Elsevier’s copyrighted works and from assisting,\naiding, or abetting any other person or business entity in engaging in unlawful access to,\nuse, reproduction, and/or distribution of Elsevier’s copyrighted works.\n2. The TLD Registries for the Defendants’ websites, or their administrators shall transfer\nownership of the domains listed in Exhibit B hereto to Elsevier Inc.\n3. Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 504(c), Elsevier is awarded statutory damages against the\nDefendants for copyright infringement in the amount of $150,000 for each of the 100\ninfringed copyrights identified in Exhibit A to this Permanent Injunction, for a total of\n$15,000,000, which award shall bear interest from the date of this Permanent Injunction\nat the rate provided by law.\n4. Defendants shall destroy all unauthorized copies of Elsevier’s copyrighted works that\nthey have in their possession, custody, or control.\n5. In the event that Elsevier discovers that any of the Defendants have violated any of the\nterms of this Permanent Injunction, whether in connection with websites identified in\nthese proceedings, new websites owned or operated by Defendants, or through any other\nmeans, Elsevier may move the Court for a supplemental order as may be appropriate to\neffectuate the purposes of this Permanent Injunction.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 81-1 Filed 05/16/17 Page 4 of 4\n6. The bond posted to secure the Preliminary Injunction in this litigation shall be returned.\n7. This Court shall retain jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of this litigation\nfor the purpose of interpretation and enforcement of this Permanent Injunction.\nThis is a FINAL JUDGEMENT\nThe Clerk of Court is directed to close this case.\nDated: _________, 2017\nNew York, New York ____________________________\nRobert W.

(collectively “Plaintiffs” or “Elsevier”) submit this\nMemorandum of Law in Support of their Mortion for Default Judgment and Permanent\nInjunction against Defendants Alexandra Elbakyan, Sci-Hub d/b/a www.sci-hub.org (collectively\nthe “Sci-Hub Defendants”), and The Library Genesis Project d/b/a Libgen.org, and the John Doe\noperators of the websites Libgen.info, Elibgen.org, Estrorecollege.org, Bookfi.org, and\nBookfi.net (collectively the “LibGen Defendants”), for copyright infringement under the\nCopyright Act, 17 U.S.C. §§ 101, et seq. and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (“CFAA”) 18\nU.S.C. § 1030. This Court has subject matter jursisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1331.\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\nThe Defendants in this action are the individuals and entities responsible for enterprises\nwhich are responsible for the piracy of copyrighted scientific, technical, engineering, and\nmedical books and journal articles on an almost unfathomable scale. Defendants’ websites exist\nfor the sole purpose of providing unauthorized and unlawful access to the copyrighted works of\nElsevier and other scientific publishers. Collectively, Defendants are responsible for the piracy\nof millions of Elseviers’ copyrighted works as well as millions of works published by others.\nDespite having been served with process in this action, and Defendant Alexandra Elbakyan\nhaving submitted letters to the Court and attended Court conferences telephonically, Defendants\nhave failed to respond. Moreover, following this Court’s entry of a preliminary injunction\nagainst them, which resulted in the suspension of a number of domain names which the\nDefendants had used in the course of their unlawful scheme, Defendants have continued to\noperate their piracy enterprises at other domain names, in flagrant disregard of the terms of the\npreliminary injunction.\n1\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 82 Filed 05/16/17 Page 7 of 28\nIn light of Defendants’ default, Elsevier now seeks entry of a default judgment and\npermanent injuunction against Defendants. Specifically, Elsevier seeks (1) a permanent\ninjunction restraining Defendants from further unlawful access to, use, reproduction, and/or\ndistribution of Elsevier’s copyrighted works; and (2) $15,000,000 in statutory damages for\nwillful infringement against Defendants.\nA. Procedural History\nElsevier initiated this action against Defendants on June 3, 2015.1 On June 11, 2015,\nElsevier applied for (1) an order authorizing alternate service of process on Defendants, and (2)\nan Order to Show Cause for Preliminary Injunction.2 The Court authorized alternate service of\nprocess and issued the Order to Show Cause on June 18, 2015.3\nB. Defendants Have Been Properly Served and Are Aware of This Action\nAs provided for by the Court’s Order authorizing alternate service of process, Plaintiffs\nserved the Summons and Complaint in this action on all Defendants by email, and attempted to\nserve Defendant Elbakyan by postal mail.4 Plaintiffs have continued to serve copies of Court\nOrders, letters, motions and supporting materials on Defendants by email as authorized by the\nCourt’s Order.5\nDefendant Elbakyan, the admitted operator of Sci-Hub, has indicated her awareness of\nthis action through (1) her participation in two teleconferences with the Court, on July 7 and July\n1 Complaint, Dkt. 1.\n2 Order to Show Cause, Dkt. 5.\n3 Order, Dkt. 15.\n4 Certificates of Service, Dkts. 24 – 30. As directed by the Court’s Order, service on Defendant Alexandra\nElbakyan was attempted by postal mail to Zhumabaeva, 172, Almaty, Kazakhstan 050014 (Dkt. 25). The materials\nmailed to that address, however, were returned unopened. In response to counsel’s inquiry, the United States Postal\nService as to the status of the mailed materials, and was informed that the postal service of Kazakhstan was unable\ndeliver the parcel as addressed.

Accordingly, Elsevier requested that the\nClerk of Court enter a Certificate of Default against all Defendants, pursuant to Local Rule 55.1,\non February 16, 2017.14 The Clerk entered Defendants’ default on February 16, 2017.15 Notice\nof that default was sent to all Defendants on February 22, 2017.16\nALLEGATIONS IN THE COMPLAINT\nElsevier is a world leading provider of professional information solutions in the Science,\nMedical, and Health sectors and publishes, markets, sells, and licenses academic textbooks,\njournals, and examinations in the fields of science, medicine, and health.17 Elsevier publishes a\nsizable portion of the world’s peer-reviewed, full-text scientific, technical, and medical\ncontent.18 The majority of Elsevier’s institutional customers are universities, governmental\nentities, educational institutions, and hospitals that purchase physical and electronic copies of\nElsevier’s products and access to Elsevier’s digital libraries.19 These institutional customers\ninclude entites located in the Southern District of New York.20 Elsevier distributes its scientific\njournal articles and book chapters electronically via its proprietary subscription database\n“ScienceDirect” (www.sciencedirect.com), through which more than 15 million researchers,\nhealth care professionals, teachers, students, and information professionals are afforded access to\napproximately 2,500 different journals and more than 26,000 books.21 Elsevier provides access\nto ScienceDirect through subscriptions it sells to its institutional customers, which permit their\n14 Request for Entry of Default, Dkt. 78.\n15 Clerk’s Certificate of Default, Dkt. 80, attached as DeMarco Decl., Exhibit A.\n16 DeMarco Decl., ¶ 10.\n17 Complaint, ¶ 18.\n18 Id. ¶ 19.\n19 Id. ¶ 18.\n20 Id. ¶ 27.\n21 Id. ¶¶ 18, 19.

When a Sci-Hub user requests\nan article, the Sci-Hub website first checks to see if a copy of the article is available through The\nLibrary Genesis Project, and if so provides the user that copy.28 If, on the other hand, the article\nis not already available through The Library Genesis Project, Sci-Hub obtains an unauthorized\ncopy of the article using its unauthorized access credentials and subsequently provides a copy of\n22 Complaint, ¶ 20.\n23 Id.\n24 Id. ¶¶ 38-40.\n25 Id. ¶¶ 6, 7.\n26 Id. ¶ 28.\n27 Id. ¶ 29.\n28 Id. ¶ 32.\n5\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 82 Filed 05/16/17 Page 11 of 28\nthe article both to the user and to The Library Genesis Project repository.29 Elsevier has never\nauthorized any of the Defendants to copy or distribute any of Elsevier’s copyrighted works.30\nDefendants monetize their infringing enterprise by accepting donations or payments\nthrough a variety of payment processors, including PayPal, Yandex, WebMoney, QiQi, and\nBitcoin.31\nARGUMENT\nI. ELSEVIER IS ENTITLED TO A DEFAULT JUDGMENT AGAINST\nDEFENDANTS BASED UPON THE WELL-PLEADED ALLEGATIONS\nWHICH ARE DEEMED ADMITTED UPON DEFENDANTS’ DEFAULT\nElsevier is entitled to default judgement under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55\nbecause Defendants have failed to appear or answer the Complaint. See Citigroup Global Mkts,\nInc. v. JWS 1999 Holding B.V., No. 08 Civ. 5362 (RJS), 2009 WL 2981912, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nSept. 11, 2009) (“Entry of default judgment is appropriate when the adversary process has been\nhalted because of an essentially unresponsive party.”) (internal quotations and citations omitted).\nAll Defendants in this matter were properly served, in the method provided in the Court’s Order\nauthorizing alternate service, and have failed to file an answer or otherwise respond.32\nA. Personal Jurisdiction\nDefendants’ failure to answer the Complaint and the Clerk’s entry of Defendants’\ndefaults precludes them from raising any meritorious defense to the claims asserted against them\nbecause “[e]ntry of default constitutes an admission of well-pleaded allegations of the complaint\nby the defaulted party.” FTC v. 1263523 Ontario, Inc., 205 F.

Accordingly, for purposes of Plaintiffs’ motion for default\njudgment, Defendants, by their default, have conceded all well-pleaded allegations of the\nComplaint as described above.\nThe Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants in this case. Federal courts look to\nthe law of the forum state to determine whether a defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction.\nSee Spiegel v. Schulmann, 604 F.3d 72, 76 (2d Cir. 2010). Section 302(a)(3)(ii) of the New York\nCPLR provides that a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant\nwhen he “commits a tortious act without the state causing injury to a person or property within\nthe state … if he … expects or should reasonably expect the act to have consequences in the state\nand derives substantial revenue from interstate or international commerce.” N.Y. C.P.L.R. §\n302(a)(3)(ii).\nElsevier has alleged claims of copyright infringement, which is a tort. See Rogers v.\neColor Studio, No. 11-CV-4493 (ARR) (RER), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28332, at *6 (E.D.N.Y.\nFeb. 7, 2013) (“Copyright infringement is a commercial tort.”) report and recommendation\nadopted by 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27029 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 27, 2013). While we have been unable\nto conclusively identify the location of all of the Defendants in this action as a result of their\n7\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 82 Filed 05/16/17 Page 13 of 28\nfailure to appear and participate in Discovery, our investigation has indicated that none of the\nDefendants or their computer servers are likely located in the United States. As alleged in the\nComplaint, Defendants appear to operate primarily in Europe, and specifically in Russia,\nKazakhstan, and the Netherlands.33 Elsevier Inc., a company with its principal place of business\nin New York, is injured in New York when its copyrights are infringed via the Internet.34 See\nPenguin Grp. (USA) Inc. v. Am. Buddha, 640 F.3d 497, 501 (2d Cir. 2011). Elsevier has also\nestablished that Defendants should have reasonably expected their cyber-piracy to have\nconsequences in New York where Elsevier is located. See McGraw-Hill Cos., Inc. v. Ingenium\nTechs. Corp., 375 F. Supp. 2d 252, 256 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (finding it “reasonably foreseeable that\nthe provision of materials that infringe the copyrights and trademarks of a New York company\nwill have consequences in New York”). “This is particularly true where, as here, Defendants are\nfound to have infringed Plaintiff’s copyright knowingly and willfully.” See Rogers, 2013 U.S.\nDist. LEXIS 28332, at *8. Finally, as discussed below, publicly-available log data concerning\nthe Sci-Hub service indicates that a substantial number of Sci-Hub users are physically located in\nNew York City and that Sci-Hub, through those logs, is aware of that fact.35 As described\nabove, Defendants have monetized their infringement by accepting monetary payments and\ndonations over the Internet. Accordingly, Defendants are subject to this Court’s personal\njurisdiction pursuant to New York’s long-arm statute.36\nActions under the civil provisions of the CFAA are also tort actions. Tradition Chile\nAgentes de Valores Ltda. v. ICAP Sec. USA LLC., No. 09 civ. 10343, 2010 WL 4739938, at *7\n33 Complaint, Dkt. 1, ¶¶ 5-9.\n34 Id. ¶ 2.\n35 Woltermann Decl. ¶¶ 9-12.\n36 A separate Due Process analysis is unnecessary, as New York’s CPLR does not extend to the limit of Due\nProcess. D.H. Blair & Co. v. Gottdiener, 462 F.3d 95, 105 (2d Cir. 2006) (“[T]he constitutional requirements of\npersonal jurisdiction are satisfied because application of N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 302(a) meets due process requirements.”).\n8\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 82 Filed 05/16/17 Page 14 of 28\n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 5, 2010) (recognizing civil actions under the CFAA as tort actions).\nAccordingly, for the reasons described above, this Court also has personal jurisdiction over the\nSci-Hub Defendants relating to their CFAA violations.\nThis Court may also exercise personal jurisdiction over the Sci-Hub Defendants under\nN.Y. C.P.L.R. § 302(a)(3)(i), which authorizes jurisdiction over a defendant who “commits a\ntortious act without the state causing injury to person or property within the state … if he\nregularly does or solicits business, or engages in any other persistent course of conduct … in the\nstate.” As described above, the Sci-Hub Defendants’ actions constitute a tortious act outside the\nstate which causes injury to Elsevier within the state. Moreover, an analysis of Sci-Hub’s log\ndata indicates that Sci-Hub distributes thousands of infringing works per month to individuals\nlocated in New York City alone.37\nB. Defendants Are Liable for Copyright Infringement\nTo prevail on its copyright claims, Elsevier must prove (1) ownership of a valid\ncopyright, and (2) copying of constituent elements of the work that are original. The word\n‘copying’ is shorthand for the infringing of any of the copyright owner’s five exclusive rights\ndescribed in § 106.” Getty Images (US) v. Microsoft Corp., No. 14-cv-7114, 2014 WL 6633032,\nat *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 24, 2014) (citing Arista Records LLC v. Doe 3, 604 F.3d 110, 117 (2d Cir.\n2010); see also Feist Publ’ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340, 361 (1991). Among\nthese exclusive rights are reproduction and distribution. 17 U.S.C. § 106. For purposes of\ninfringement analysis, exclusive licensees are regarded as copyright owners. See, e.g., Morris v.\nBusiness Concepts, Inc., 259 F.3d 65, 70 (2d Cir. 2001), 17 U.S.C. § 201(d)(2). In the context of\nInternet-based distribution schemes, both “uploading and downloading copyrighted materials are\ninfringing acts. The former violates the copyright holder’s right to distribution, the latter the right to\n37 Woltermann Decl. ¶ 12.\n9\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 82 Filed 05/16/17 Page 15 of 28\nreproduction.” Columbia Pictures Indus. Inc. v. Fung, 710 F.3d 1020, 1034 (9th Cir. 2013) (citing\n17 U.S.C. § 106(1), (3)).\nPlaintiffs have alleged that they are either the owner of or the exclusive licensee of the\ncopyrights in the vast majority of the works they distribute through their ScienceDirect platform.38\nMoreover, Elsevier has identified specific works in which it holds the copyright or exclusive\ndistribution rights, which have been infringed by the LibGen Defendants by being copied to and\ndistributed from their websites and by the Sci-Hub Defendants by distributing unauthorized copies to\nindividuals located in the United States.39 Elsevier has not assigned, licensed, or transferred the\ncopyrights in the works in which it holds the copyright or exclusive distribution rights, to any of\nthe Defendants, nor has it authorized any of the Defendants to copy or distribute any such\nworks.40 As alleged in the Complaint, Defendants have engaged in the large-scale and\nsystematic unauthorized copying of Elsevier’s copyrighted works and the subsequent\nunauthorized distribution of copies of those works to their users.41\nII. ELSEVIER IS ENTITLED TO STATUTORY DAMAGES FOR\nDEFENDANTS’ WILLFUL INFRINGEMENT OF ITS COPYRIGHTED\nWORKS\nUpon establishment of liability against a defaulting defendant, “unless the amount of\ndamages is certain, the court is required to make an independent determination of the sum to be\nawarded.” Briarpatch Ltd. L.P. v. Geisler Roberdeau, Inc., 513 F. Supp.2d 1, 3 (S.D.N.Y.\n2007). Here, Elsevier seeks a judgment of $15,000,000 against the Defendants, representing the\nmaximum statutory damages amount of $150,000 per work for willful infringement, applied to a\nrepresentative pool of 100 works infringed by the Defendants. For the reasons described below,\n38 Complaint, Dkt. 1, ¶ 18.\n39 Woltermann Decl. ¶¶ 14, 20, Exhibit B.\n40 Complaint, Dkt. 1, ¶ 39.\n41 Id. ¶¶ 29, 35-40.\n10\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 82 Filed 05/16/17 Page 16 of 28\nthe request for these amounts is reasonable, appropriate, and well supported by the purpose and\ngoals of the statutory damages provisions of the Copyright Act. It is appropriate for the court to\naward the maximum damages amount per work for willful infringement because of the\nintentional nature, scope and manner of Defendants’ infringing activities. At the same time,\napplying the maximum statutory damages amount per work to a smaller representive pool of the\noverall infringements yields judgments for amounts that reasonably serves key purpose of the\ndamages provisions of the Copyright Act: to discourage the Defendants’ infringements and deter\nsimilar infringements by others.\nElsevier has pursued these claims to obtain an injunction ordering the infringements to\nstop and for money damages likewise meant to discourage and deter continued infringements. If\nthe court determines that less than the maximum statutory amount should be applied, Elsevier\nrequests that the Court still award an amount per work in the higher end of the statutory range,\nbut in no event less than $30,000 per work, for these same reasons and purposes.\nA. Statutory Damages Under the Copyright Act\nThe Copyright Act provides for two ranges of statutory damages for infringement,\ndepending on whether a defendant’s infringment is willful or non-willful, with damages\nmeasured on a per-work basis. “Statutory damages are available without proof of plaintiff’s\nactual damages and are useful where proof of actual damages or profits is insufficient [and] serve\nthe dual purpose of compensating the plaintiff for an injury and discouraging a defendant’s\nwrongful conduct.” EMI April Music Inc. V. 4MM Games, LLC, No. 12-cv-2080, 2014 WL\n325933, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 13, 2014). For non-willful infringement, the Act provides for\ndamages ranging from $750 to $30,000 per infringed work. 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(1). Should a\ncourt find that the defendant’s infringement was willful, however, the Act provides for damages\n11\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 82 Filed 05/16/17 Page 17 of 28\nranging up to a maximum of $150,000 per infringed work. 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(2). The actual\namount of the award is subject to the court’s discretion. See Fitzgerald Publ’g Co. v. Baylor\nPubl’g Co., 807 F.2d 1110, 1116 (2d Cir. 1986). In determining an appropriate damage award\nunder the Copyright Act, “courts look to considerations such as: (1) the expenses saved and the\nprofits reaped; (2) the revenues lost by the plaintiff; (3) the value of the copyright; (4) the\ndeterrent effect on others besides the defendant; (5) whether the defendant’s conduct was\ninnocent or willful; (6) whether a defendant has cooperated in providing particular records from\nwhich to assess the value of the infringing material produced; and (7) the potential for\ndiscouraging the defendant.” See Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregrations of Am. v. Royal\nFood Distribs. LLC, 665 F. Supp. 2d 434, 436 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (quoting Fitzgerald Pub. Co. v.\nBaylor Pub. Co., 807 F.2d 1110, 1117 (2d Cir. 1986)).\nElsevier, through the allegations in its Complaint, has alleged sufficient facts to establish\nthat Defendants have infringed Elsevier’s copyrights. Elsevier is the owner or exclusive licensee\nof the majority of the content it distributes through the ScienceDirect platform,42 and owns the\nfederally-registered copyrights in all of the works identifed in Exhibit A.43 Defendants have\nengaged in the large-scale copying and distribution of Elsevier’s copyrighted works without\nElsevier’s authorization, including by copying and distributing the copyrighted works identified\nin Exhibit A.44 Elsevier has alleged that Defendants’ actions have been willful, intentional, and\npurposeful, in disregard of and indifferent to Elsevier’s rights.45 Because these facts are deemed\ntrue upon Defendants’ default, the Defendants are liable for willful copyright infringement.\n42 Complaint, Dkt. 1, ¶ 18.\n43 Woltermann Decl., ¶ 20.\n44 Complaint, Dkt. 1, ¶¶ 27-39.\n45 Id. ¶ 44.\n12\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 82 Filed 05/16/17 Page 18 of 28\nB. Defendants Are Willful Infringers\nTo prove that an infringer’s conduct was willful, a plaintiff must demonstrate either “(1)\nthat the defendant was actually aware of the infringing activity, or (2) that the defendant’s\nactions were the result of ‘reckless disregard’ for, or ‘willful blindness’ to, the copyright holder’s\nrights.” Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Prana Hospitality, Inc., 158 F. Supp.3d 184, 197 (S.D.N.Y.\n2016) (citing Island Software and Computer Serv., Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 413 F.3d 257, 263\n(2d Cir. 2005)). Such “knowledge may be actual or constructive. In other words, it need not be\nproven directly but may be inferred from the defendant’s conduct.” N.A.S. Import, Corp. v.\nChenson Enterprises, Inc., 968 F.2d 250, 252 (2d Cir. 1992) (internal quotations and citation\nomitted), see also Broadcast Music, Inc., 158 F. Supp.3d at 197, “Willfulness may be inferred\nfrom a defendant’s conduct, and is often found where a defendant continued the infringing\nbehavior after receiving notice of the license requirement or directions to cease and desist.”\n(internal citations omitted).\nAs noted above, Defendants have had ample notice of this action, both through service of\nprocess and by the Plaintiffs’ actions which have resulted in actions taken by top-level domain\nregistries that rendered Defendants’ original websites non-functional. This court may therefore\ndeem Defendants’ infringement willful simply on the basis of their default. See Tiffany (NJ) Inc.\nv. Luban, 282 F. Supp.2d 123, 124 (S.D.N.Y. 2003). However, even beyond default, the record\nin this matter makes clear that Defendants acted willfully, because their actions and statements\ndemonstrate that they both are aware of Elsevier’s copyright rights and have consiously chosen\nto disregard those rights. Following the disruption of their original domain names under the\nPreliminary Injunction in this matter, the Sci-Hub Defendants and several of the LibGen\nDefendants relocated their infringing enterprises to new domain names, largely within TLDs\n13\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 82 Filed 05/16/17 Page 19 of 28\noutside the reach of this Court.46 Defendants have taken no steps to curtail their infringing\nactivity by removing Elsevier’s copyrighted works from their services, and routinely make bold\nstatements regarding the scope of their infringing activities.47 Indeed, the Sci-Hub Defendants\nhave made numerous public pronouncements concerning the extent of their piracy scheme,\nincluding in a letter to this Court in which Elbakyan admits to Sci-Hub’s infringing nature.48\nMoreover, as alleged in the Complaint, each and every one of the Defendants’ websites appears\nto have no substantial purpose other than to engage in and facilitate the large-scale piracy of\ncopyrighted works belonging to Elsevier and other publishers.49 These facts are certainly\nsufficient to find that that the Defendants have acted wilfully.\nC. Elsevier’s Request for Statutory Damages is Reasonable\nStatutory damages under the Copyright Act serve to “discourage wrongful conduct as\nwell as to provide reparation for injury. A “statutory damage award should significantly exceed\nthe amount of unpaid license fees so as to put infringers on notice that it costs less to obey the\ncopyright laws than to violate them.” Broadcast Music, Inc., 158 F. Supp.3d at 197-98. (internal\ncitations and quotations omitted). In cases where willful conduct rises to the level of “truly\negregious” conduct, Second Circuit courts will consider the maximum statutory award of\n$150,000. Reilly v. Commerce, No. 15-CV-05118, 2016 WL 6837895, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 31,\n2016). Truly egregious conduct justifying the maximum statutory award includes situations\nwhere an infringer “continues infringing activities after being put on notice by a court that its\nactivities may constitute an infringement, or where the plaintiff shows the infringer's high\n46 Woltermann Decl. ¶¶ 5, 7; DeMarco Decl. ¶ 9.\n47 Woltermann Decl. ¶¶ 16, 17.\n48 Id., Letter, Elbakyan to Court, Dkt. 50.

Oct. 3, 2012).\nNotably, courts in this District have, in circumstances analogous to or less egregious than\nthose present here, awarded the maximum statutory damages permitted under the Copyright Act.\nSee, e.g., Elsevier v. Kozlov, No. 14-cv-2422, Default Judgment and Permanent Injunction, Dkt.\n58 (April 13, 2015) (award of $150,000 for each of 250 works infringed by operators of piracy\nwebsite who had notice of action and chose not to appear); Hounddog Productions LLC v.\nEmpire Film Group, Inc. 826 F. Supp.2d 619, 631 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (maximum statutory\ndamages appropriate where defendant continued to distribute work after receiving notice that it\nno longer had distribution rights); National Football League v. Primetime 24 Joint Venture, 131\nF. Supp.2d 458, 479-80 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (awarding then-maximum statutory damages of\n$100,000 per infringed work where defendant broadcaster was “knowing or at least reckless” in\nits infringement of the NFL’s copyrights);\nHere, Defendants’ willful conduct rises to the level of truly egregious conduct, justifying\nthe maximum statutory damages of $150,000 per infringed work.50 The Preliminary Injunction\nconstituted such notice by a court, and Defendants have flagrantly disregarded the Preliminary\nInjunction by continuing to operate their piracy enterprises. Moreover, Elbakyan has publicly\nstated that she is aware that Sci-Hub’s actions are unlawful and that this Court has enjoined her\n50 Elsevier requests statutory damages relating only to 100 identified infringed works, rather than the millions\nof Elsevier’s copyrighted works which Defendants have infringed. Elsevier does to in an effort to obtain an award\nthat serves a sufficient deterrent function while not requesting this Court reach an absurd result. Arista Records LLC\nv. Lime Group LLC, 784 F. Supp.2d 313, 317 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (noting that strict multiplication of maximum\nstatutory damages by the number of infringed works could result in awards measured in the billions or trillions of\ndollars, which would be an absurd result the Court could not endorse).\n15\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 82 Filed 05/16/17 Page 21 of 28\ninfringing activities, but that she intends to continue to defy the Court’s Order.51 The LibGen\nDefendants were also served with the Preliminary Injunction and have continued their infringing\nactivities even after the suspension of their original domains.52 Finally, through their statements\nand their conduct, Defendants have made clear that they have at all times been aware that their\nconduct constitutes Copyright Infringement and that their services have been designed solely to\npursue that unlawful end.\nHere, the scale of Defendants’ infringement is so staggering that a reasonable estimate of\nappropriate damages, even if based on a lower, license- fee-based metric, would be difficult, if\nnot impossible, to calculate. As alleged in the Complaint, the LibGen Defendants, at the time of\nthe Complaint, hosted more than 40 million scientific works, the large majority of which are\nsubject to copyright protection.53 Since The Library Genesis Project’s repository has been\naugmented by Sci-Hub’s continuing piracy of new works, it is evident that his number has\nsubstantially increased since that time. At the time of the Complaint, LibGen had obtained such\na high portion of the copyrighted materials available on ScienceDirect that Elsevier’s\ninvestigation found it difficult to locate a ScienceDirect-hosted article which was not illegally\navailable through The Library Genesis Project’s repository.54 Elsevier’s analysis of the\nbibliographic database detailing the contents of The Library Genesis Project’s repository as of\nMarch 17, 2015, revealed that it contained more than 29,000 Elsevier imprint book titles and\napproximately 12 million articles associated with Elsevier branding.55 Since the vast majority of\n51 Woltermann Decl. ¶ 16.\n52 Id. ¶ 7.\n53 Complaint, Dkt. 1, ¶ 30.\n54 Declaration of A. Woltermann in support of Plaintiff’s Application for an Order Authorizing Alternative\nService of Process on Defendants and for Preliminary Injunction, Dkt. 8, ¶ 21.\n55 Id. ¶¶ 22 - 23.\n16\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 82 Filed 05/16/17 Page 22 of 28\nthe Elsevier content on ScienceDirect requires a license for access, the resulting statutory\ndamages appropriate in this case would quickly reach astronomical heights. To avoid this result,\nElsevier is not seeking an award based on license fees for the millions of Elsevier’s copyrighted\nworks which Defendants have infringed. Rather, Elsevier seeks statutory damages in amounts\nthat serve the statutory purposes of such damages to discourage and deter infringement by\nlimiting its request to a representative sampling of one hundred infringed works, listed in Exhibit\nA. Elsevier has verified that each of the works listed in Exhibit A is subject to Elsevier’s\nfederally-registered copyright and available for download from The Library Genesis Project.56\nSci-Hub does not itself host the articles it provides to its users. Based on the public\nstatements of Alexandra Elbakyan, Sci-Hub’s admitted operator, however, we can gain some\nappreciation of the enormity of Sci-Hub’s infringing reproductions and distribution activities.\nSci-Hub’s profile on vk.com currently claims that Sci-Hub provides access to more than 60\nmillion peer-reviewed scientific articles.57 In addition, while Sci-Hub has not participated in this\naction, frustrating Elseviers’ ability to seek discovery as to the scale of its infringement and the\nidentities of the infringed works, Elbakyan has been substantially more forthcoming in other\narenas. Notably, however, in connection with an article about Sci-Hub published in the journal\nScience, Elbakyan provided not only substantial admissions as to how Sci-Hub operates, but also\nraw data regarding Sci-Hub’s traffic. This data, which has also been published and made\npublicly available, indicates that in the period between September, 2015, and February, 2016 (a\nperiod which includes four months after the entry of the Preliminary Injunction in this case), Sci-\nHub served approximately 28 million documents to its users.58 As noted in the Complaint,\n56 Woltermann Decl. ¶¶ 19-21.\n57 Id. ¶ 17.\n58 Id. ¶ 12.\n17\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 82 Filed 05/16/17 Page 23 of 28\nElsevier publishes a substantial portion of all peer-reviewed scientific journal content.59 Again,\nassuming that almost all of the content that Elsevier provides on ScienceDirect requires a license\nto access, a request for statutory damages as to each of these works would result in an enormous\nstatutory damages figure.\nThat sum, of course, would only relate to Sci-Hub’s activity during a single six-month\nperiod. The actual amount would be much larger.\nRather than engage in this form of estimation, however, Elsevier has limited its request\nfor statutory damages against the Sci-Hub Defendants to one hundred representative works,\nidentified in Exhibit A.60 The Sci-Hub log files provided to Science included the DOIs of each\narticle downloaded and the geolocation of the recipient of each article.61 Parsing that data\nreveals approximately 74,000 works which were downloaded by individuals in New York City\nalone.62 Elsevier has identified one hundred specific works (1) which were admittedly served by\nSci-Hub to its users, (2) in which Elsevier holds the federally-registered copyright, and (3) which\nare also available through The Library Genesis Project.63 By awarding Elsevier the maximum\nstatutory damages for willful copyright infringement for each of these one hundred works (i.e.,\n$15,000,000 in aggregate), this Court can provide a substantial award which serves to discourage\nand deter future infringement.\nD. An Evidentiary Hearing is Not Required to Determine Statutory Damages\nIn the Second Circuit, the Court is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing on the\nissue of damages in the context of default judgement “as long as it ensured that there [is] a basis\n59 Complaint, Dkt. 1, ¶ 19.\n60 Digital Object Identifier – a unique identification code which specifies a particular publication.\n61 Woltermann Decl. ¶ 11.\n62 Id. ¶ 12.\n63 Id. ¶¶ 14, 19-20.\n18\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 82 Filed 05/16/17 Page 24 of 28\nfor the damages specified in the default judgment.” Briarpatch Ltd. L.P. v. Geisler Roberdeau,\nInc., 513 F. Supp.2d 1, 4 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (quoting Transatlantic Marine Claims Agency v. Ace\nShipping Corp., 109 F.3d 105, 111 (2d Cir. 1997). Rather, “a district court may rely on detailed\naffidavits and documentary evidence supplemented by the District Judge’s personal knowledge\nof the record.” Id. (quoting Fustok v. ContiCommodity Servs., Inc., 873 F.2d 38, 40 (2d Cir.\n1989) (finding it unnecessary to hold a post-default evidentiary hearing where the court could\nrely on affidavits and documentary evidence). Therefore, based on the Plaintiffs’ filings in this\napplication and throughout the course of this litigation, an evidentiary hearing on the issue of\nawarding statutory damages is not necessary.\nIII. DEFENDANTS SHOULD BE PERMANENTLY ENJOINED FROM\nFURTHER INFRINGEMENT OF ELSEVIER’S COPYRIGHTS\n“A court may issue an injunction when the moving party establishes that there is a\nstatutory basis for relief and that it meets the prerequisites for the issuance of an injunction. The\nsecond of these conditions requires that a party seeking an injunction demonstrate irreparable\nharm and the absence of an adequate remedy at law.” TigerCandy Arts, Inc. v. Blairson Corp.,\nNo. 09-Civ-6215 (GBD), 2012 WL 760168, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 23, 2012) (internal quotations\nand citation omitted). “In intellectual property actions, such permanent injunctions generally are\ngranted when there is a threat of continuing violations.” Id. (internal quotations and citation\nomitted).\nThe first requirement is met because both the Copyright Act and the CFAA authorize\ninjunctive relief. Section 502 of the Copyright Act provides a Court the ability to provide\ninjuncive relief “on such terms as it may deem reasonable to prevent or restrain infringement of a\ncopyright.” 17 U.S.C. § 502(a). The CFAA likewise permits a civil plaintiff to seek injunctive\nrelief. 18 U.S.C. § 1030(g). The second requirement is also satisfied because Elsevier, as the\n19\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 82 Filed 05/16/17 Page 25 of 28\nresult of Defendants’ infringement, has been injured and will continue to suffer an injury for\nwhich there is no adequate remedy at law. Defendants, by their relocation of their unlawful\nenterprises to new domain names in defiance of the preliminary injunction in this case, have\nclearly demonstrated their intention to continue to infringe. The manifestation of this intent\nwarrants entry of a permanent injunction. See TigerCandy Arts, 2012 WL 1948816, at *8\n(permanent injunction warranted where defendants defaulted and evinced intention of continuing\ntheir infringing activity after plaintiffs’ cease-and-desist demands); Software Freedom\nConservancy, Inc. v. Best Buy Co., No. 09-Civ10155 (SAS), 2010 WL 2985320, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.\nJuly 27, 2010) (permanent injunction granted where defendants’ conduct continued even after\nbeing informed that it was infringing). Defendants’ response was not to cease their infringing\nactivities, but rather to simply relocate their enterprises to domain names within TLDs outside\nthe reach of United States courts.64 These actions are clearly designed to allow Defendants to\ncontinue their infringing activities while simultaneously frustrating the Court’s ability to provide\nElsevier meaningful recourse.\nThe public interest would also be served by the proposed injunction. In issuing the\nPreliminary Injunction, this Court expressly addressed the balance of interests at play in this\nmatter, noting that in light of the competing public interests between the rights of copyright\nowners and the rights of users, “Elbakyan’s solution to the problems she identifies, simply\nmaking copyrighted content available for free via a foreign website, disserves the public\ninterest.”65 In fact, the Defendants’ activities harm the public interest by creating an atmosphere\nwhere publishers, authors, and scentists are all harmed. Defendants’ piracy reduces the\neconomic incentives of publishers’ to invest not only in new pulbications, but also from\n64 DeMarco Decl. ¶ 9.\n65 Order, Dkt. 53, at 14.\n20\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 82 Filed 05/16/17 Page 26 of 28\ndeveloping new and innovative tools through which scientific knowledge can be better\ndisseminated.66 Defendants’ scheme harms authors of scientific books, who rely on royalty\npayments to earn a living or supplement their income.67 Finally, Defendants’ archives harm\nscientists who may rely on the pirated materials, unaware of potentially critical revisions or\nretractions.68\nIn light of Defendants’ ongoing, flagrant infringement, their location in other countries,\nand their nearly complete disregard for this lawsuit, Elsevier is aware that it is quite likely that\nthe Defendants will not comply with the requested permanent injunction just as they have\nignored the Preliminary Injunction. Nevertheless, Elsevier requests injuctive relief not only to\nenjoin Defendants from further infringement, but also to make permanent the provisions of the\nPreliminary Injunction relating to suspension of Defendants’ domain names by ordering those\ndomain names’ transfer to Elsevier’s ownership.\nThe reasons for the injunction transferring Defendants’ domain names are compelling.\nDefendants’ enterprises exist for the sole purpose of infringement and Defendants have\ndemonstrated their intent to continue infringing despite their knowledge of this lawsuit and the\nunlawfulness of their actions. It is appropriate to require the surrender of the domain names used\nfor their unlawful activities. At present, it also is perhaps one of the only remedies practically\navailable to Elsevier and a surrender ensures that such domains administered within the US will\nno longer be used for illegal infringing activities.\nAn injunction requiring the transfer of the domain names associated with the infringing\nsites is appropriate where, as here, Defendants are likely to continue their unlawful conduct. See\n66 Doda Decl. ¶ 13.\n67 Id. ¶ 14.\n68 Id. ¶ 15.\n21\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 82 Filed 05/16/17 Page 27 of 28\nCraigslist, Inc. v. Doe, Case No. C09-4739 SI, 2011 WL 1897423, at *12 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 25,\n2011) (“Based on the likelihood that [defendant] will continue his unlawful conduct, I …\nrecommend that [plaintiff’s] request for the transfer of [defendant’s] websites … be granted.”),\nreport and recommendation adopted by 2011 WL 1884555, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53204 (N.D.\nCal. May 18, 2011). Courts in this district have granted similar injunctive relief against\ninfringers. See, e.g., Phillip Morris USA, Inc. v. Otamedia, Ltd., 331 F.Supp. 2d 228, 247\n(S.D.N.Y. 2004) (modifying injunction and ordering that defendant’s domain names be\ntransferred to plaintiff); True Religion Apparel, Inc. v. Xiaokang Lee, No. 11-Civ-8242 (HB)\n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 12, 2012), (issuing default judgment and permanent injunction ordering transfer\nof defendant’s domain names); Pearson Educ., Inc. v. Nugroho, Case No. 08-CV-8034 (DAB)\n(AJP) (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 10, 2013) Order, ECF No. 53, (modifying permanent injunction to order\ntransfer of defendant’s domain names). Taken as a whole, all of the factors weigh in favor of the\npermanent injunction Elsevier requests.\nCONCLUSION\nThe mass infringement of Elsevier’s copyrighted works by both the Sci-Hub Defendants\nand the LibGen Defendants has cause and will continue to cause irreparable harm to Elsevier.\nDespite being made aware of this litigation and the Preliminary Injunction against their\ninfringing activities, Defendants have persisted in their unlawful course of conduct and nearly\nentirely ignored these proceedings. Elsevier therefore respectfully requests that the Court enter\ndefault judgement (1) awarding statutory damages of up to $15,000,000 against the Defendants,\n(2) permanently enjoining Defendants from infringing Elseviers copyrights, and (3) ordering the\ntransfer of Defendants’ domain names listed in Exhibit B to Elsevier’s ownership.\n22\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 82 Filed 05/16/17 Page 28 of 28\nDated: New York, New York\nMay 16, 2017\nDEVORE & DEMARCO LLP\nBy: /s/ Joseph V.

I participated in two teleconferences with this Court relating to this matter (each\nbefore Hon. Ronnie Abrams) on July 7 and July 14, 2015.

Following the entry of the Preliminary Injunction in this matter (entered October\n30, 2015, Dkt. 53), I provided a copy of the Preliminary Injunction to the Public Interest\nRegistry, which is the top-level domain registry for the “.org” top-level domain, and requested\nthat the Public Interest Registry disable the domains estrorecollege.org, sci-hub.org, elibgen.org,\nand bookfi.org.\n6.

DODA IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR\nDEFAULT JUDGMENT AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION\nI, PAUL F. DODA, declare as follows is true and correct:\n1. I submit this declaration in support of Plaintiffs’ motion for default judgment and\npermanent injunction against the Defendants in the above-captioned matter.\n2. I am Global Litigation Counsel at Elsevier Inc. (together with Elsevier B.V. and\nElsevier Ltd, the “Plaintiffs” or “Elsevier”). In that capacity, I am responsible for and familiar\nwith Elsevier’s copyright enforcement matters, including its investigation of and responses to\nonline piracy and content theft. My office is located at 230 Park Avenue, New York, New York\n10169. I have been employed by Elsevier since 2007, and have been a lawyer within the wider\nRELX Group of companies (f/k/a Reed Elsevier) since 2001.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 84 Filed 05/16/17 Page 2 of 5\nA. Elsevier’s ScienceDirect Platform\n3. Elsevier publishes more than 2,500 scholarly journals and approximately 365,000\narticles annually in those journals. Elsevier is also a leading publisher of scholarly books,\npublishing approximately 33,000 books. Elsevier operates the “ScienceDirect” online platform,\nthrough which users can access Elsevier’s journals and book content. There are over 12 million\nscientific journal articles and 33,000 books accessible from ScienceDirect.\nB. Defendants’ Continuing Unlawful Distribution of Elsevier Content\n4. Defendant Library Genesis Project is an illegal online repository of copyrighted\nworks, including scientific articles and book chapters illegally obtained from ScienceDirect. The\nLibrary Genesis Project repository is also accessed through a number of “mirror” websites,\nincluding Bookfi.org. At the time this suit was filed, the Library Genesis Project maintained\nwebsites reachable at a number of Internet addresses, including at the URL’s “libgen.org.” and\n“Bookfi.org.”\n5. I understand that several of The Library Genesis Project’s original domain names\nand those of its mirrors – including libgen.org, libgen.info, elibgen.org, bookfi.org, and\nestrorecollege.org – no longer direct to active websites.\n6. I understand, however, that The Library Genesis Project has continued to operate\nits infringing service through several other domains, as have its mirrors, including libgen.io and\nbookfi.net.\n7. The Sci-Hub Defendants operate a service which enables its users to unlawfully\nobtain copyrighted scientific works from a number of publisher databases, including\nScienceDirect. At the time this suit was filed, Sci-Hub’s website was located at the domain sci-\nhub.org. The Sci-Hub Defendants obtain access credentials belonging to individuals, such as\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 84 Filed 05/16/17 Page 3 of 5\nuniversity students, at institutions who maintain ScienceDirect subscriptions. Using these\ncredentials, Sci-Hub accesses ScienceDirect and illegally downloads copies of copyrighted\nworks made available thereon.\n8. Sci-Hub’s original domain name – www.sci-hub.org – does not currently direct to\nan active website, nor has it since approximately November, 2015.\n9. The Sci-Hub website has, however, since November, 2015, continued to operate\nat a number of new domains, which include sci-hub.ac, sci-hub.bz, sci-hub.cc, and sci-hub.io.\n10. Elsevier has not at any time authorized the Library Genesis Project, Sci-Hub, or\nDefendant Alexandra Elbakyan to distribute any of Elsevier’s copyrighted works through any\nchannel, including through the libgen.io, sci-hub.ac, sci-hub.bz, sci-hub.cc, and sci-hub.io\nwebsites.\nC. The Public Harm Caused by Defendants\n11. Defendants’ ongoing contempt of this Court’s October 28, 2015 Opinion and\nOrder (“Order”), which is attached hereto as Exhibit A, and circumvention of the Order through\nthe adoption of new domain names, means that Defendants continue to irreparably harm science\npublishers and the scientific publishing ecosystem on which universities, faculty, students,\nresearchers, authors, professionals, and the public depend.\n12. Defendants’ illegal activities harm the communities whose interests they purport\nto serve. As this Court’s Order observed, the harm from the massive infringement of publishers’\ncopyrights ultimately harms the public interest in the creation of, and access to, scientific\nresearch: “simply making copyrighted content available for free…disserves the public\ninterest….[T]here is a ‘delicate ecosystem which supports scientific research worldwide’... and\ncopyright law plays a critical function within that system. ‘Inadequate protections for copyright\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 84 Filed 05/16/17 Page 4 of 5\nowners can threaten the very store of knowledge to be accessed; encouraging the production of\ncreative work ultimately serves the public interest in promoting the accessibility of such works’.”\nOrder, p. 14.\n13. Defendants’ purported goal to serve the public interest by providing free access to\nscientific articles and books ignores the fact that publishers make significant investments, not\nonly in new publications and new areas of study, but also in the development of innovative tools\nthat allow for the most advantageous use of their publications and the data therein. Publishers\nmust recoup costs and earn profits to sustain and continue these activities that benefit the science\nand research community.\n14. Defendants’ massive infringement scheme includes the piracy of millions of\nbooks. Thus, in addition to the harm caused to commercial science publishers large and small,\nand to non-profit scholarly societies whose publishing activities fund programs for scholars and\nscientists, there are thousands of authors who are harmed that rely on royalties to earn a living or\nsupplement their income.\n15. Beyond the harm to the direct participants in the scientific publishing ecosystem,\nDefendants’ illegal infringing activities continue to pose a threat to the public record of science\nand therefore to the public at large. As detailed in my prior Declaration, dated May 6, 2015, the\nintegrity of an accurate scientific record, and the attendant public health benefits therefrom, is an\nimportant public policy goal of the U.S. Department of Health and Human\nServices. Defendants’ ongoing maintenance and proliferation of an alternative scientific record\nthat exists outside established industry-wide standards for retractions and corrections of articles\npresents a public health and safety issue.

Based upon the\nfacts and conclusions below, the motion is granted and the\nDefendants are prohibited from distributing the Plaintiffs'\ncopyrighted works.\nPrior Proceedings\nElsevier, a major publisher of scientific journal articles\nand book chapters, brought this action on June 2, 2015, alleging\nthat the Defendants, a series of websites affiliated with the\nProject (the \"Website Defendants\") and their owner and operator,\nAlexandra Elbakyan, infringed Elsevier's copyrighted works and\nviolated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. (See generally\nComplaint, Dkt. No. 1.) Elsevier filed the instant motion for a\npreliminary injunction on June 11, 2015, via an Order to Show\nCause. (Dkt. Nos. 5-13.)

(See Transcript, Dkt. No. 38.) After the\nconference, Judge Abrams issued an Order directing Elbakyan to\nnotify the Court whether she wished assistance in obtaining pro\nbono counsel, and advising her that while she could proceed pro\nse, the Website Defendants, not being natural persons, must\nobtain counsel or risk default. (Dkt. No. 36.) A second\ntelephonic conference was held on July 14, 2015, during which\nElbakyan stated that she needed additional time to find a\nlawyer. (See Transcript, Dkt. No. 42.) Judge Abrams granted\nthe request, but warned Elbakyan \"you have to move quickly\nth~t\nboth in attempting to retain an attorney and you'll have to\nstick to the schedule that is set once it's set.\" (Id. at 6.)\nAfter the telephone conference, Judge Abrams issued another\nOrder setting the preliminary injunction hearing for September\n16 and directing Elbakyan to inform the Court by July 21 if she\nwished assistance in obtaining pro bono counsel.

Although Elbakyan acknowledges that she is the \"main\noperator of sci-hub.org website\" (Dkt.

Because\nthe Website Defendants did not retain an attorney to defend this\naction, they are in default.\nHowever, the Website Defendants' default does not\nautomatically entitle the Plaintiffs to an injunction, nor does\nthe fact that Elbakyan's submission raises no merits-based\nchallenge to the Plaintiffs' claims. See Thurman v. Bun Bun\nMusic, No. 13 Civ. 5194, 2015 WL 2168134, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. May 7,\n2015).

(See\nComplaint, Dkt. No. 1, at 11-13.) In order to prevail on a\nclaim for infringement of copyright, \"two elements must be\nproven: (1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copying of\nconstituent elements of the work that are original.\" Arista\nRecords, LLC v. Doe 3, 604 F.3d 110, 117 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting\nFeist Publ'ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340, 361\n(1991)).\nElsevier has made a substantial evidentiary showing,\ndocumenting the manner in which the Defendants access its\nScienceDirect database of scientific literature and post\ncopyrighted material on their own websites free of charge.\nAccording to Elsevier, the Defendants gain access to\nScienceDirect by using credentials fraudulently obtained from\neducational institutions, including educational institutions\nlocated in the Southern District of New York, which are granted\nlegitimate access to ScienceDirect. · (See Declaration of Anthony\nWoltermann (the \"Woltermann Dec.\"), Dkt. No. 8, at 13-14.) As\nan attachment to one of the supporting declarations to this\nmotion, Elsevier includes a sequence of screenshots showing how\na user could go to ~ww.sc:-hub.org, one of the Website\n6\n\nCCaassee 1 1:1:155-c-cvv-0-044228822-R-RWWSS D Dooccuummeennt t8 543-1 F Fileiledd 1 005/3/106/1/157 P Paaggee 7 7 o of f1 188\nDefendants, search for information on a scientific article, get\na set of search results, click on a link, and be redirected to a\ncopyrighted article on ScienceDirect, via a proxy. (See\nWolterman Dec. at 41-44 and Ex. U.) Elsevier also points to a\nTwitter post (in Russian) indicating that whenever an article is\ndownloaded via this method, the Defendants save a copy on their\nown servers. (See Declaration of David M. Hirschberg, Dkt. No.\n12, Ex. B.) As specific examples, Elsevier includes copies of\ntwo of its articles accessed via the Defendants' websites, along\nwith their copyright registrations. (Declaration of Paul F.\nDoda, Dkt. No. 9, Exs. B-D.) This showing demonstrates a\nlikelihood of success on Elsevier's copyright infringement\nclaims.\nElsevier also shows a likelihood of success on its claim\nunder the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (\"CFAA\") . The CFAA\nprohibits, inter alia, obtaining information from \"any protected\ncomputer\" without authorization, 18 U. S.C. § 1030 (a) (2) (C), and\nobtaining anything of value by accessing any protected computer\nwith intent to defraud. Id. § (a) (4). The definition of\n\"protected computer\" includes one \"which is used in or affecting\ninterstate or foreign commerce or communication, including a\ncomputer located outside the United States that is used in a\nmanner that affects interstate or foreign commerce or\ncommunication of the United States.\" Id. § (el (2) (B); Nexans\n7\n\nCCaassee 1 1:1:155-c-cvv-0-044228822-R-RWWSS D Dooccuummeennt t8 543-1 F Fileiledd 1 005/3/106/1/157 P Paaggee 8 8 o of f1 188\n....\nWires S.A. v. Sark-USA, Inc., 166 F. App'x 559, 562 n.5 (2d Cir.\n2006). Elsevier's ScienceDirect database is located on multiple\nservers throughout the world and is accessed by educational\ninstitutions and their students, and qualifies as a computer\nused in interstate commerce, and therefore as a protected\ncomputer under the CFAA. (See Woltermann Dec. at 2-3.) As\nfound above, Elsevier has shown that the Defendants' access to\nScienceDirect was unauthorized and accomplished via fraudulent\nuniversity credentials. While the CfAA requires a civil\nplaintiff to have suffered over $5,000 in damage or loss, see\nRegister.com, Inc. v. Verio, Inc., 356 F.3d 393, 439 (2d Cir.\n2004), Elsevier has made the necessary showing since it\ndocumented between 2,000 and 8,500 of its articles being added\nto the LibGen database each day (Woltermann Dec. at 8, Exs. G &\nH) and because its articles carry purchase prices of between\n$19.95 and $41.95 each. Id. at 2; see Millennium TGA, Inc. v.\nLeon, No. 12 Civ. 1360, 2013 WL 5719079, at *10 (E.D.N.Y. Oct.\n18, 2013)\n.1\nElsevier's evidence is also buttressed by Elbakyan's\nsubmission, in which she frankly admits to copyright\ninfringement. (See Dkt. No. 50.) She discusses her time as a\n1 While Elsevier's articles are likely sufficient on their own to qualify as\n\"[]thing[s] of value\" under the CFAA, Elbakyan acknowledges in her submission\nthat the Defendants derive revenue from their website. (See Letter, Dkt. No.\n50, at 1 (\"That is true that website collects donations, however we do not\npressure anyone to send them.\").)\n8\n\nCCaassee 1 1:1:155-c-cvv-0-044228822-R-RWWSS D Dooccuummeennt t8 543-1 F Fileiledd 1 005/3/106/1/157 P Paaggee 9 9 o of f1 188\nstudent at a university in Kazakhstan, where she did not have\naccess to research papers and found the prices charged to be\n\"just insane.\" (Id. at 1.) She obtained the papers she needed\n\"by pirating them,\" and found may similar students and\nresearchers, predominantly in developing countries, who were in\nsimilar situations and helped each other illicitly obtain\nresearch materials that they could not access legitimately or\nafford on the open market. (Id.) As Elbakyan describes it, \"I\ncould obtain any paper by pirating it, so I solved many requests\nand people always were very grateful for my help. After that, I\ncreated sci-hub.org website that simply makes this process\nautomatic and the website immediately became popular.\" (Id.)\nGiven Elsevier's strong evidentiary showing and Elbakyan's\nadmissions, the first prong of the preliminary injunction test\nis firmly established.\nB. Irreparable Harm\nIrreparable harm is present \"where, but for the grant of\nequitable relief, there is a substantial chance that upon final\nresolution of the action the parties cannot be returned to the\npositions they previously occupied.\" Brenntag Int'l Chems.,\nInc. v. Bank of India, 175 F.3d 245, 249 (2d Cir. 1999). Here,\nthere is irreparable harm because it is entirely likely that the\n9\n\n..

It\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to determine how much\nmoney the Plaintiffs have lost due to the availability of\nthousands of their articles on the Defendant websites; some\npercentage of those articles would no doubt have been paid for\nlegitimately if they were not downloadable for free, but there\nappears to be no way of determining how many that would be.\nThere is also the matter of harm caused by \"viral infringement,\"\nwhere Elsevier's content could be transmitted and retransmitted\nby third parties who acquired it from the Defendants even after\nthe Defendants' websites were shut down. See WPIX, Inc. v. ivi,\nInc., 765 F. Supp. 2d 594, 620 (S.D.N.Y. 2011), aff'd 691 F.3d\n275 (2d Cir. 2012). \"[C]ourts have tended to issue injunctions\nin this context because 'to prove the loss of sales due to\ninfringement is notoriously difficult.'\" Salinger v.\nColting, 607 F.3d 68, 81 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting Omega Importing\nCorp. v. Petri-Kine Camera Co., 451 F.2d 1190, 1195 (2d Cir.\n1971) (Friendly, J.)).\nAdditionally, the harm done to the Plaintiffs is likely\nirreparable because the scale of any money damages would\ndramatically exceed Defendants' ability to pay. Brenntag, 175\nF.3d at 249-50 (explaining that even where money damages can be\n10\n\nCCaassee 1 1:1:155-c-cvv-0-044228822-R-RWWSS D Dooccuummeennt t8 543-1 F Fileiledd 1 005/3/106/1/157 P Paaggee 1 111 o of f1 188\nquantified, there is irreparable harm when a defendant will be\nunable to cover the damages). It is highly likely that the\nDefendants' activities will be found to be willful - Elbakyan\nherself refers to the websites' activities as \"pirating\" (Dkt.\nNo. 50 at 1) - in which case they would be liable for between\n$750 and $150,000 in statutory damages for each pirated work.\nSee 17 U.S.C. § 504(c); HarperCollins Publishers LLC v. Open\nRoad Integrated Media, LLP, 58 F. Supp. 3d 380, 387 (S.D.N.Y.\n2014). Since the Plaintiffs credibly allege that the Defendants\ninfringe an average of over 3,000 new articles each day\n(Woltermann Deel. at 7), even if the Court were to award damages\nat the lower end of the statutory range the Defendants'\nliability could be extensive. Since the Defendants are an\nindividual and a set of websites supported by voluntary\ndonations, the potential damages are likely to be far beyond the\nDefendants' ability to pay.\nC. Balance of Hardships\nThe balance of hardships clearly tips in favor of the\nPlaintiffs. Elsevier has shown that it is likely to succeed on\nthe merits, and that it continues to suffer irreparable harm due\nto the Defendants' making its copyrighted material available for\nfree. As for the Defendants, \"it is axiomatic that an infringer\n11\n\nCCaassee 1 1:1:155-c-cvv-0-044228822-R-RWWSS D Dooccuummeennt t8 543-1 F Fileiledd 1 005/3/106/1/157 P Paaggee 1 122 o of f1 188\nof copyright cannot complain about the loss of ability to offer\nits infringing product.\" WPIX, 691 F.3d at 287 (quotation\nomitted). The Defendants cannot be legally harmed by the fact\nthat they cannot continue to steal the Plaintiff's content, even\nif they tried to do so for public-spirited reasons. See id.\nD. Public Interest\nTo the extent that Elbakyan mounts a legal challenge to the\nmotion for a preliminary injunction, it is on the public\ninterest prong of the test. In her letter to the Court, she\nnotes that there are \"lots of researchers . especially in\ndeveloping countries\" who do not have access to key scientific\npapers owned by Elsevier and similar organizations, and who\ncannot afford to pay the high fees that Elsevier charges. (Dkt.\nNo. 50, at 1.) Elbakyan states in her letter that Elsevier\n\"operates by racket: if you do not send money, you will not read\nany papers. On my website, any person can read as many papers\nas they want for free, and sending donations is their free will.\nWhy Elsevier cannot work like this, I wonder?\" (Id.) Elbakyan\nalso notes that researchers do not actually receive money in\nexchange for granting Elsevier a copyright. (Id.) Rather, she\nalleges they give Elsevier ownership of their works \"because\nElsevier is an owner of so-called 'high-impact' journals. If a\n12\n\nCCaassee 1 1:1:155-c-cvv-0-044228822-R-RWWSS D Dooccuummeennt t8 543-1 F Fileiledd 1 005/3/106/1/157 P Paaggee 1 133 o of f1 188\nresearcher wants to be recognized, make a career - he or she\nneeds to have publications in such journals.\" (Id. at 1-2.)\nElbakyan notes that prominent researchers have made attempts to\nboycott Elsevier and states that \"[t]he general opinion in\nresearch community is that research papers should be distributed\nfor free (open access), not sold. And practices of such\ncompanies like Elsevier are unacceptable, because they limit\ndistribution of knowledge.\" (Id. at 2.)\nElsevier contends that the public interest favors the\nissuance of an injunction because doing so will \"protect the\ndelicate ecosystem which supports scientific research\nworldwide.\" (Pl.'s Br., Dkt. No. 6, at 21.) It states that the\nmoney it generates by selling access. to scientific research is\nused to support new discoveries, to create new journals, and to\nmaintain a \"definitive and accurate record of scientific\ndiscovery.\" (Id.) It also argues that allowing its articles to\nbe widely distributed risks the spread of bad science - while\nElsevier corrects and retracts articles whose conclusions are\nlater found to be flawed, it has no way of doing so when the\ncontent is taken out of its control. (Id. at 22.) Lastly,\nElsevier argues that injunctive relief against the Defendants is\nimportant to deter \"cyber-crime,\" while failing to issue an\ninjunction will incentivize pirates to continue to publish\ncopyrighted works.\n13\n\nCCaassee 1 1:1:155-c-cvv-0-044228822-R-RWWSS D Dooccuummeennt t8 543-1 F Fileiledd 1 005/3/106/1/157 P Paaggee 1 144 o of f1 188\nIt cannot be denied that there is a compelling public\ninterest in fostering scientific achievement, and that ensuring\nbroad access to scientific research is an important component of\nthat effort. As the Second Circuit has noted, \"[c]opyright law\ninherently balances [] two competing public interests . the\nrights of users and the public interest in broad accessibility\nof creative works, and the rights of copyright owners and the\npublic interest in rewarding and incentivizing creative efforts\n(the 'owner-user balance').\" WPIX, 691 F.3d at 287. Elbakyan's\nsolution to the problems she identifies, simply making\ncopyrighted content available for free via a foreign website,\ndisserves the public interest. As the Plaintiffs have\nestablished, there is a \"delicate ecosystem which supports\nscientific research worldwide,\" (Pl.'s Br., Dkt. No. 6 at 21),\nand copyright law pays a critical function within that system.\n\"Inadequate protections for copyright owners can threaten the\nvery store of knowledge to be accessed; encouraging the\nproduction of creative work thus ultimately serves the public's\ninterest in promoting the accessibility of such works.\" WPIX,\n691 F.3d at 287. The existence of Elsevier shows that\npublication of scientific research ~enerates substantial\neconomic value.\nThe public's interest in the broad diffusion of scientific\nknowledge is sustained by two critical exceptions in copyright\n14\n\nCCaassee 1 1:1:155-c-cvv-0-044228822-R-RWWSS D Dooccuummeennt t8 543-1 F Fileiledd 1 005/3/106/1/157 P Paaggee 1 155 o of f1 188\nlaw. First, the \"idea/expression dichotomy11 ensures that while\na scientific article may be subject to copyright, the ideas and\ninsights within that article are not. See 17 U.S.C. § 102(b)\n(\"In no case does copyright protection for an original work of\nauthorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system,\nmethod of operation, concept, principle, or discovery11 \"Due\n) •\nto this distinction, every idea, theory, and fact in a\ncopyrighted work becomes instantly available for public\nexploitation at the moment of publication. 11 Eldred v. Ashcroft,\n537 U.S. 186, 219 (2003). So while Elsevier may be able to keep\nits actual articles behind a paywall, the discoveries within\nthem are fair game for anyone. Secondly, the \"fair use11\ndoctrine, codified at 17 U.S.C. § 107, allows the public to use\nexpressions, as well as ideas, \"for purposes such as criticism,\ncomment, news reporting, teaching . . scholarship, or\nresearch11 without being liable for copyright infringement.\n(emphasis added) Under this doctrine, Elsevier's articles\nthemselves may be taken and used, but only for legitimate\npurposes, and not for wholesale infringement. See Eldred, 537\nU.S. at 219. 2 The public interest in the broad dissemination and\nuse of scientific research is protected by the idea/expression\ndichotomy and the fair use doctrine. See Golan v. Holder, 132\n2 The public interest in wide d1sseminat1on of scientific works is also served\nby the fact that copyrights are given only limited duration. See Sony Corp.\nof Am. V. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 431-32 (1984).\n15\n\nCCaassee 1 1:1:155-c-cvv-0-044228822-R-RWWSS D Dooccuummeennt t8 543-1 F Fileiledd 1 005/3/106/1/157 P Paaggee 1 166 o of f1 188\nS. Ct. 873, 890 (2012); Eldred, 537 U.S. at 219. Given the\nimportance of scientific research and the critical role that\ncopyright plays in promoting it, the public interest weighs in\nfavor of an injunction.\nConclusion\nFor the reasons set forth above, the motion for a\npreliminary injunction is granted.

I am a Technology Infrastructure and Operations Manager at Elsevier Inc. My\noffice is located at 9443 Springboro Pike, Miamisburg, Ohio 45342, Office 61 41.\n3. I have worked for the RELX (f/k/a Reed Elsevier) group of companies for 20\nyears. For the last 11 years, I have worked specifically for Elsevier Inc. (“Elsevier”).\n4. I have continued to monitor the infringing activities of Sci-Hub throughout the\ncourse of this litigation. Sci-Hub’s original domain name – www.sci-hub.org – does not\ncurrently direct to an active website, nor, to my knowledge has it since approximately\nNovember, 2015.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 85 Filed 05/16/17 Page 2 of 6\n5. The Sci-Hub website has, however, since November, 2015, continued to operate\nat a number of new domains, which, to my knowledge, include sci-hub.ac, sci-hub.bz, sci-hub.cc,\nsci-hub.io.\n6. I have also continued to monitor the activities of The Library Genesis Project\nthroughout the course of this litigation. Several of The Library Genesis Project’s original\ndomain names and those of its mirrors – including libgen.org, libgen.info, elibgen.org,\nbookfi.org, and estrorecollege.org – no longer direct to active websites.\n7. The Library Genesis Project has, however, continued to operate its infringing\nservice through several other domains, as have its mirrors. These include, to my knowledge,\nlibgen.io and bookfi.net.\n8. Based on my review of the Defendants’ websites, it is clear that Defendants have\ncontinued to distribute unauthorized copies of Elsevier’s copyrighted scientific books and journal\narticles on a continuous basis since November, 2015.\nA. Sci-Hub’s Admitted Infringements\n9. On April 28, 2016, the journal Science published an article, authored by John\nBohannon and entitled “Who’s Downloading Pirated Papers? Everyone,”1 to its website at\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/whos-downloading-pirated-papers-everyone. A true\nand correct copy of this article is attached hereto as Exhibit A.\n10. The article described Sci-Hub’s infringing activities and included information, in\nthe form of defendant Alexandra Elbakyan’s written responses to Mr. Bohannon’s inquiries and\nhis analysis of Sci-Hub’s server logs, which were provided by Elbakyan – the operator of Sci-\nHub – to Mr. Bohannon.\n1 “Who's downloading pirated papers? Everyone,” Bohannon, J., Science, Vol. 352, Issue 6285 (2016), pp.\n508-512. http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.352.6285.508.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 85 Filed 05/16/17 Page 3 of 6\n11. The data logs referenced in the article were also published under the authorship of\nMr. Bohannon and Elbakyan with the title “Data from: Who’s Downloading Pirated Papers?\nEveryone,”2 and made available for public review through the Dryad website at\nhttp://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.q447c.3 The data provide evidence of Sci-\nHub’s distribution of scientific articles from approximately September, 2015, through February,\n2016 (with the exception of a period during November, 2015). Specifically, the data provide\ndetailed transactional information including the unique DOI (an index number which uniquely\nidentifies a published journal article) for each download, and the geographic location to which\nthe file was sent.\n12. The data logs referenced above indicate that during that period, Sci-Hub\ndistributed approximately 28 million journal articles to its users. As Bohannon’s article in\nScience notes, and defendant Elbakyan provided data that confirms, Elsevier was the most\ncommon victim of Sci-Hub’s infringement, remarking that “Sci-Hub provided half-a-million\ndownloads of Elsevier papers in one recent week.” The article also states that New York City\nitself is a common target of Sci-Hub’s infringement, and specifically that “[o]ver the 6-month\nperiod, 74,000 download requests came from IP addresses in New York City”.\n13. I and individuals working at my direction have downloaded and analyzed the log\ndata published to the Dryad website and reviewed that data to determine the extent of Sci-Hub’s\npiracy of Elsevier’s copyrighted works. I have concluded that, based on the published logs\nprovided by defendant Elbakyan, Sci-Hub claims to have distributed millions of copies of\nElsevier-published scientific journal articles during the relevant period.\n2 “Data from: Who's downloading pirated papers?

Attached hereto as Exhibit B is a listing of one hundred representative Elsevier-\npublished works which Sci-Hub, through the publication of its server logs to the Dryad website,\nadmits to having distributed to users in the United States.\n15. Elbakyan has also admitted to her operation of the infringing Sci-Hub websites in\ninterviews with various media outlets. One such interview was published by Vox.com on\nFebruary 18, 2016, and entitled “Meet Alexandra Elbakyan, the researcher who's breaking the\nlaw to make science free for all.”4 A true and correct copy of this interview is attached hereto as\nExhibit C.\n16. In the Vox.com interview, Elbakyan admits that she is aware of the injunction\nbarring her infringing activities and that she nevertheless intended to continue operating Sci-\nHub. Specifically, Elbakyan states “We got an injunction from US court, an order to stop our\nactivities. A few weeks ago I got an email that stated that another conference with court is\nscheduled for March, because our websites are operating despite receiving an injunction order.”\n17. Sci-Hub maintains a presence on the Russian social media platform VK at\nvk.com/sci_hub. Sci-Hub’s profile, when translated to English, describes Sci-Hub as having\n“already more than 60 million research papers in the public domain: down with copyright in\nscience.” A true and correct screenshot of Sci-Hub’s VK page, retrieved April 29, 2017, along\nwith a translation of this description and the affirmation of David Lyness, an Account Manager\nat TransPerfect certifying the accuracy of this translation, are attached hereto as Exhibit D.\n4 Belluz, Julia, Meet Alexandra Elbakyan, the researcher who's breaking the law to make science free for all,\nVox.com, Feb. 18, 2016, at http://www.vox.com/2016/2/18/11047052/alexandra-elbakyan-interview.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 85 Filed 05/16/17 Page 5 of 6\nB.

YOU/SCIENCE\nWho's downloading pirated papers? Everyone\nBy John Bohannon Apr. 28, 2016 , 2:00 PM\nJust as spring arrived last month in Iran, Meysam Rahimi sat down at his university computer and immediately ran into a problem: how to\nget the scientific papers he needed. He had to write up a research proposal for his engineering Ph.D. at Amirkabir University of Technology in\nTehran. His project straddles both operations management and behavioral economics, so Rahimi had a lot of ground to cover.\nBut every time he found the abstract of a relevant paper, he hit a paywall. Although Amirkabir is one of the top research universities in Iran,\ninternational sanctions and economic woes have left it with poor access to journals. To read a 2011 paper in Applied Mathematics and\nComputation, Rahimi would have to pay the publisher, Elsevier, $28. A 2015 paper in Operations Research, published by the U.S.‑based\ncompany INFORMS, would cost $30.\nRelated content:\nThe frustrated science student behind Sci‑Hub\nAlexandra Elbakyan founded Sci‑Hub to thwart journal paywalls\nMy love‑hate of Sci‑Hub\nEditorial by Marcia McNutt, Editor‑in‑Chief, Science suite of journals\nIt's a Sci‑Hub world data set\nData set and details on Sci‑Hub server\nHe looked at his list of abstracts and did the math. Purchasing the papers was going to cost $1000 this week alone—about as much as his\nmonthly living expenses—and he would probably need to read research papers at this rate for years to come. Rahimi was peeved.\n“Publishers give nothing to the authors, so why should they receive anything more than a small amount for managing the journal?”\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 85-1 Filed 05/16/17 Page 2 of 7\nMany academic publishers offer programs to help researchers in poor countries access papers, but only one, called Share Link, seemed\n \nrelevant to the papers that Rahimi sought. It would require him to contact authors individually to get links to their work, and such links go\ndead 50 days after a paper’s publication. The choice seemed clear: Either quit the Ph.D. or illegally obtain copies of the papers. So like\nmillions of other researchers, he turned to Sci‑Hub, the world’s largest pirate website for scholarly literature. Rahimi felt no guilt. As he sees\nit, high‑priced journals “may be slowing down the growth of science severely.”\nThe journal publishers take a very different view. “I’m all for universal access, but not theft!” tweeted Elsevier’s director of universal access,\nAlicia Wise, on 14 March during a heated public debate over Sci‑Hub. “There are lots of legal ways to get access.” Wise’s tweet included a link\nto a list of 20 of the company’s access initiatives, including Share Link.\nG. Grullón/Science\nBut in increasing numbers, researchers around the world are turning to Sci‑Hub, which hosts 50 million papers and counting. Over the 6\nmonths leading up to March, Sci‑Hub served up 28 million documents. More than 2.6 million download requests came from Iran, 3.4 million\nfrom India, and 4.4 million from China. The papers cover every scientific topic, from obscure physics experiments published decades ago to\nthe latest breakthroughs in biotechnology. The publisher with the most requested Sci‑Hub articles? It is Elsevier by a long shot—Sci‑Hub\nprovided half‑a‑million downloads of Elsevier papers in one recent week.\nThese statistics are based on extensive server log data supplied by Alexandra Elbakyan, the neuroscientist who created Sci‑Hub in 2011\nas a 22‑year‑old graduate student in Kazakhstan. I asked her for the data because, in spite of the flurry of polarized opinion pieces, blog\nposts, and tweets about Sci‑Hub and what effect it has on research and academic publishing, some of the most basic questions remain\nunanswered: Who are Sci‑Hub’s users, where are they, and what are they reading?\nFor someone denounced as a criminal by powerful corporations and scholarly societies, Elbakyan was surprisingly forthcoming and\ntransparent. After establishing contact through an encrypted chat system, she worked with me over the course of several weeks to create a\ndata set for public release: every download event over the 6‑month period starting 1 September 2015, including the digital object identifier\n(DOI) for every paper. To protect the privacy of Sci‑Hub users, we agreed that she would first aggregate users’ geographic locations to the\nnearest city using data from Google Maps; no identifying internet protocol (IP) addresses were given to me. (The data set and details on\nhow it was analyzed are freely accessible)\nIt's a Sci­Hub world\nServer log data for the website Sci­Hub from September 2015 through February paint a revealing portrait of its users and their diverse interests.\nSci­Hub had 28 million download requests, from all regions of the world and covering most scientific disciplines.\n© OpenStreetMap contributors © CARTO, © CARTO\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 85-1 Filed 05/16/17 Page 3 of 7\nElbakyan also answered nearly every question I had about her operation of the website, interaction with users, and even her personal life.\n \nAmong the few things she would not disclose is her current location, because she is at risk of financial ruin, extradition, and imprisonment\nbecause of a lawsuit launched by Elsevier last year.\nThe Sci‑Hub data provide the first detailed view of what is becoming the world’s de facto open‑access research library. Among the\nrevelations that may surprise both fans and foes alike: Sci‑Hub users are not limited to the developing world. Some critics of Sci‑Hub have\ncomplained that many users can access the same papers through their libraries but turn to Sci‑Hub instead—for convenience rather than\nnecessity. The data provide some support for that claim. The United States is the fifth largest downloader after Russia, and a quarter of the\nSci‑Hub requests for papers came from the 34 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the wealthiest\nnations with, supposedly, the best journal access. In fact, some of the most intense use of Sci‑Hub appears to be happening on the\ncampuses of U.S. and European universities.\nIn October last year, a New York judge ruled in favor of Elsevier, decreeing that Sci‑Hub infringes on the publisher’s legal rights as the\ncopyright holder of its journal content, and ordered that the website desist. The injunction has had little effect, as the server data reveal.\nAlthough the sci‑hub.org web domain was seized in November 2015, the servers that power Sci‑Hub are based in Russia, beyond the\ninfluence of the U.S. legal system. Barely skipping a beat, the site popped back up on a different domain.\nIt’s hard to discern how threatened by Sci‑Hub Elsevier and other major publishers truly feel, in part because legal download totals aren’t\ntypically made public. An Elsevier report in 2010, however, estimated more than 1 billion downloads for all publishers for the year, suggesting\nSci‑Hub may be siphoning off under 5% of normal traffic. Still, many are concerned that Sci‑Hub will prove as disruptive to the academic\npublishing business as the pirate site Napster was for the music industry (see editorial by Marcia McNutt on her love‑hate of Sci‑Hub). “I\ndon’t endorse illegal tactics,” says Peter Suber, director of the Office for Scholarly Communications at Harvard University and one of the\nleading experts on open‑access publishing. However, “a lawsuit isn’t going to stop it, nor is there any obvious technical means. Everyone\nshould be thinking about the fact that this is here to stay.”\nIt is easy to understand why journal publishers might see Sci‑Hub as a threat. It is as simple to use as Google’s search engine, and as long as\nyou know the DOI or title of a paper, it is more reliable for finding the full text. Chances are, you’ll find what you’re looking for. Along with\nbook chapters, monographs, and conference proceedings, Sci‑Hub has amassed copies of the majority of scholarly articles ever published.\nIt continues to grow: When someone requests a paper not already on Sci‑Hub, it pirates a copy and adds it to the repository.\nElbakyan declined to say exactly how she obtains the papers, but she did confirm that it involves online credentials: the user IDs and\npasswords of people or institutions with legitimate access to journal content. She says that many academics have donated them voluntarily.\nPublishers have alleged that Sci‑Hub relies on phishing emails to trick researchers, for example by having them log in at fake journal\nwebsites. “I cannot confirm the exact source of the credentials,” Elbakyan told me, “but can confirm that I did not send any phishing emails\nmyself.”\nSo by design, Sci‑Hub’s content is driven by what scholars seek. The January paper in The Astronomical Journal describing a possible new\nplanet on the outskirts of our solar system? The 2015 Nature paper describing oxygen on comet 67P/Churyumov‑Gerasimenko? The paper\nin which a team genetically engineered HIV resistance into human embryos with the CRISPR method, published a month ago in the Journal\nof Assisted Reproduction and Genetics? Sci‑Hub has them all.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 85-1 Filed 05/16/17 Page 4 of 7\nSci­Hub's top 10 most downloaded papers\n \nOf the 28 million documents requested from September 2015 through February, these were the\nmost popular.\nShare\nIt has news articles from scientific journals—including many of mine in Science—as well as copies of open‑access papers, perhaps because\nof confusion on the part of users or because they are simply using Sci‑Hub as their all‑in‑one portal for papers. More than 4000 different\npapers from PLOS’s various open‑access journals, for example, can be downloaded from Sci‑Hub.\nThe flow of Sci‑Hub activity over time reflects the working lives of researchers, growing over the course of each day and then ebbing—but\nnever stopping—as night falls. (There is an 18‑day gap in the data starting 4 November 2015 when the domain sci‑hub.org went down and\nthe server logs were improperly configured.) By the end of February, the flow of Sci‑Hub papers had risen to its highest level yet: more than\n200,000 download requests per day.\nHow many Sci‑Hub users are there? The download requests came from 3 million unique IP addresses, which provides a lower bound. But the\ntrue number is much higher because thousands of people on a university campus can share the same IP address. Sci‑Hub downloaders live\non every continent except Antarctica. Of the 24,000 city locations to which they cluster, the busiest is Tehran, with 1.27 million requests.\nMuch of that is from Iranians using programs to automatically download huge swaths of Sci‑Hub’s papers to make a local mirror of the site,\nElbakyan says. Rahimi, the engineering student in Tehran, confirms this. “There are several Persian sites similar to Sci‑Hub,” he says. “So\nyou should consider Iranian illegal [paper] downloads to be five to six times higher” than what Sci‑Hub alone reveals.\nThe geography of Sci‑Hub usage generally looks like a map of scientific productivity, but with some of the richer and poorer science‑focused\nnations flipped. The smaller countries have stories of their own. Someone in Nuuk, Greenland, is reading a paper about how best to provide\ncancer treatment to indigenous populations. Research goes on in Libya, even as a civil war rages there. Someone in Benghazi is investigating\na method for transmitting data between computers across an air gap. Far to the south in the oil‑rich desert, someone near the town of Sabha\nis delving into fluid dynamics. Mapping IP addresses to real‑world locations can paint a false picture if people hide behind web proxies or\nanonymous routing services. But according to Elbakyan, fewer than 3% of Sci‑Hub users are using those.\nIn the United States and Europe, Sci‑Hub users concentrate where academic researchers are working. Over the 6‑month period, 74,000\ndownload requests came from IP addresses in New York City, home to multiple universities and scientific institutions. There were 19,000\ndownload requests from Columbus, a city with less than a tenth of New York’s population, and 68,000 from East Lansing, Michigan, which\nhas less than a hundredth. These are the homes of Ohio State University and Michigan State University (MSU), respectively.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 85-1 Filed 05/16/17 Page 5 of 7\nNeed or convenience?\nMany U.S. Sci­Hub users seem to congregate near universities that have good journal access.  \nThe 5 cities with most requests were Ashburn, VA (96,857), New York, NY (73,606), East\nLansing, MI (68,315), Fremont, CA (59,389), Mountain View, CA (56,637).\n© OpenStreetMap contributors\nShare\nThe numbers for Ashburn, Virginia, the top U.S. city with nearly 100,000 Sci‑Hub requests, are harder to interpret. The George Washington\nUniversity (GWU) in Washington, D.C., has its science and technology campus there, but Ashburn is also home to Janelia Research Campus,\nthe elite Howard Hughes Medical Institute outpost, as well as the servers of the Wikimedia Foundation, the headquarters of the online\nencyclopedia Wikipedia. Spokespeople for the latter two say their employees are unlikely to account for the traffic. The GWU press office\nresponded defensively, sending me to an online statement that the university recently issued about the impact of journal subscription rate\nhikes on its library budget. “Scholarly resources are not luxury goods,” it says. “But they are priced as though they were.”\nSeveral GWU students confessed to being Sci‑Hub fans. When she moved from Argentina to the United States in 2014 to start her\nengineering Ph.D., Natalia Clementi says her access to some key journals within the field actually worsened because GWU didn’t have\nsubscriptions to them. Researchers in Argentina may have trouble obtaining some specialty journals, she notes, but “most of them have no\nproblem accessing big journals because the government pays the subscription at all the public universities around the country.”\nEven for journals to which the university has access, Sci‑Hub is becoming the go‑to resource, says Gil Forsyth, another GWU\nengineering Ph.D. student. “If I do a search on Google Scholar and there’s no immediate PDF link, I have to click through to ‘Check Access\nthrough GWU’ and then it’s hit or miss,” he says. “If I put [the paper’s title or DOI] into Sci‑Hub, it will just work.” He says that Elsevier\npublishes the journals that he has had the most trouble accessing.\nThe GWU library system “offers a document delivery system specifically for math, physics, chemistry, and engineering faculty,” I was told by\nMaralee Csellar, the university’s director of media relations. “Graduate students who want to access an article from the Elsevier system\nshould work with their department chair, professor of the class, or their faculty thesis adviser for assistance.”\nThe intense Sci‑Hub activity in East Lansing reveals yet another motivation for using the site. Most of the downloads seem to be the work of\na few or even just one person running a “scraping” program over the December 2015 holidays, downloading papers at superhuman speeds. I\nasked Elbakyan whether those download requests came from MSU’s IP addresses, and she confirmed that they did. The papers are all from\nchemistry journals, most of them published by the American Chemical Society. So the apparent goal is to build a massive private repository\nof chemical literature. But why?\n“A lawsuit isn't going to stop [Sci‑Hub], nor is there any obvious technical means. Everyone should be\nthinking about the fact that this is here to stay.”\nPeter Suber, Harvard University\nBill Hart‑Davidson, MSU’s associate dean for graduate education, suggests that the likely answer is “text‑mining,” the use of computer\nprograms to analyze large collections of documents to generate data. When I called Hart‑Davidson, I suggested that the East Lansing Sci‑\nHub scraper might be someone from his own research team. But he laughed and said that he had no idea who it was. But he understands\nwhy the scraper goes to Sci‑Hub even though MSU subscribes to the downloaded journals. For his own research on the linguistic structure of\nscientific discourse, Hart‑Davidson obtained more than 100 years of biology papers the hard way—legally with the help of the publishers. “It\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 85-1 Filed 05/16/17 Page 6 of 7\ntook an entire year just to get permission,” says Thomas Padilla, the MSU librarian who did the negotiating. And once the hard drive full of\n \npapers arrived, it came with strict rules of use. At the end of each day of running computer programs on it from an offline computer, Padilla\nhad to walk the resulting data across campus on a thumb drive for analysis with Hart‑Davidson.\nYet Sci‑Hub has drawbacks for text‑mining research, Hart‑Davidson says. The pirated papers are in unstructured PDF format, which is hard\nfor programs to parse. But the bigger issue, he says, is that the data source is illegal. “How are you going to publish your work?” Then again,\nhaving a massive private repository of papers does allow a researcher to rapidly test hypotheses before bothering with libraries at all. And\nit’s all just a click away.\nWhile Elsevier wages a legal battle against Elbakyan and Sci‑Hub, many in the publishing industry see the fight as futile. “The numbers are\njust staggering,” one senior executive at a major publisher told me upon learning the Sci‑Hub statistics. “It suggests an almost complete\nfailure to provide a path of access for these researchers.” He works for a company that publishes some of the most heavily downloaded\ncontent on Sci‑Hub and requested anonymity so he could speak candidly.\nFor researchers at institutions that cannot afford access to journals, he says, the publishers “need to make subscription or purchase more\nreasonable for them.” Richard Gedye, the director of outreach programs for STM, the International Association of Scientific, Technical and\nMedical Publishers, disputes this. Institutions in the developing world that take advantage of the publishing industry’s outreach programs\n“have the kind of breadth of access to peer‑reviewed scientific research that is pretty much the equivalent of typical institutions in North\nAmerica or Europe.”\nAnd for all the researchers at Western universities who use Sci‑Hub instead, the anonymous publisher lays the blame on librarians for not\nmaking their online systems easier to use and educating their researchers. “I don’t think the issue is access—it’s the perception that access\nis difficult,” he says.\nSci­Hub’s most downloaded publishers\nThis analysis of 28 million Sci­Hub download requests identified publishers via their Cross­Ref\nDOIs, which do not reflect the Springer­Nature merger.\nShare\n“I don’t agree,” says Ivy Anderson, the director of collections for the California Digital Library in Oakland, which provides journal access to\nthe 240,000 researchers of the University of California system. The authentication systems that university researchers must use to read\nsubscription journals from off campus, and even sometimes on campus with personal computers, “are there to enforce publisher\nrestrictions,” she says.\nWill Sci‑Hub push the industry toward an open‑access model, where reader authentication is unnecessary? That’s not clear, Harvard’s Suber\nsays. Although Sci‑Hub helps a great many researchers, he notes, it may also carry a “strategic cost” for the open‑access movement,\nbecause publishers may take advantage of “confusion” over the legality of open‑access scholarship in general and clamp down. “Lawful\nopen access forces publishers to adapt,” he says, whereas “unlawful open access invites them to sue instead.”\nEven if arrested, Elbakyan says Sci‑Hub will not go dark. She has failsafes to keep it up and running, and user donations now cover the cost\nof Sci‑Hub’s servers. She also notes that the entire collection of 50 million papers has been copied by others many times already. “[The\npapers] do not need to be downloaded again from universities.”\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 85-1 Filed 05/16/17 Page 7 of 7\nIndeed, the data suggest that the explosive growth of Sci‑Hub is done. Elbakyan says that the proportion of download requests for papers\n \nnot contained in the database is holding steady at 4.3%. If she runs out of credentials for pirating fresh content, that gap will grow again,\nhowever—and publishers and universities are constantly devising new authentication schemes that she and her supporters will need to\noutsmart. She even asked me to donate my own Science login and password—she was only half joking.\nFor Elbakyan herself, the future is even more uncertain. Elsevier is not only charging her with copyright infringement but with illegal hacking\nunder the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. “There is the possibility to be suddenly arrested for hacking,” Elbakyan admits. Others who\nran afoul of this law have been extradited to the United States while traveling. And she is fully aware that another computer prodigy–turned‑\nadvocate, Aaron Swartz, was arrested on similar charges in 2011 after mass‑downloading academic papers. Facing devastating financial\npenalties and jail time, Swartz hanged himself.\nLike the rest of the scientific community, Elbakyan is watching the future of scholarly communication unfold fast. “I will see how all this turns\nout.”\nThe survey on attitudes toward Sci‑Hub is now closed—here are the ⍍nal results.\n*Correction, 12 May, 4:36 p.m.: The two GWU students noted in the story are pursuing engineering Ph.D.s, not physics.\nPosted in: Scientific Community\nDOI: 10.1126/science.aaf5664\nJohn Bohannon\nJohn is a Science contributing correspondent.\n Email John",

Proponents of the\nopen access movement argue that science is a public good, often funded by taxpayers,\nand that locking it up behind expensive paywalls stalls scientific progress.\nOpponents, particularly the publishers of journals, argue that there are all sorts of costs\nthat go into publishing science and those costs need to be recovered. Without publishers,\nthey argue, there would be no arbiters of science.\nEnter Alexandra Elbakyan. Hailed as a hero by open access acolytes, she's on a mission to\nmake the world's science accessible to all.\nRELATED\nWhy one woman stole 47 million academic papers — and made them all free to read\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 85-3 Filed 05/16/17 Page 2 of 6\nIn 2011, the Kazakhstan native quietly launched a site called Sci-Hub, which now hosts 47\nmillion academic papers. To be clear, this isn't legal. Elbakyan doesn't own the copyrights\nto these articles; the publishers do. That's part of the reason the global journal publisher\nElsevier took action against Elbakyan. A New York district court in October also ordered\nthat the site be taken down; it returned shortly after with a new overseas domain.\nIn Elbakyan's view, it's not just publishers who are impediments to science access —\ncopyrights should be abolished, too.\nSo far, the neuroscience researcher has managed to evade the law from her base in what\nis believed to be Russia. (She would not confirm her location.) In an email interview, I asked\nher about the legal challenges she's now facing, her guiding philosophy, and what she\nmakes of Sci-Hub's critics.\nJulia Belluz: People are calling you the \"Robin Hood of science.\" What do you think\nabout that?\nAlexandra Elbakyan: Some people can argue that this is inaccurate, since Robin Hood was\na robber and free copying of information cannot be equated to robbery. Copying is not the\nsame as stealing, because the owner does not lose his possession.\nBut if the main idea behind Robin Hood is not robbery but social justice, then I agree.\nJB: What inspired you to set up Sci-Hub?\n\"AFTER SENDING TENS OR HUNDREDS OF RESEARCH\nPAPERS MANUALLY, I WANTED TO AUTOMATE MY WORK\"\nAE: I was an active participant in online communities for scientists. These communities\nwere based on forums — the now-outdated web technology that preceded social\nnetworks. What all students and researchers were doing there is helping each other to\ndownload literature behind paywalls. I became interested and very involved. Two years\nbefore, I already had to pirate many paywalled papers while working on my final university\nproject, which was dedicated to brain-machine interfaces. So I knew well how to do this\nand had the necessary tools.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 85-3 Filed 05/16/17 Page 3 of 6\nAfter sending tens or hundreds of research papers manually, I wanted to develop a script\nthat would automate my work. That's how Sci-Hub started. The first users of the script\nwere members of the online forum about molecular biology.\nAt first, there was no goal to make all knowledge free. The script was intended to make the\nlife of the community easier, i.e., to make the process of unlocking papers faster and more\nconvenient. The idea was partially inspired by anonymizer websites. An example is\nanonymouse.org/anonwww.html. Here, you can paste the link, and it will be opened via\nproxy server.\nThese websites are used, for example, to bypass internet censorship. I was actively using\nthese websites, and then I thought — why cannot I do the same for research papers? A\nuser can paste a link to the article, and it will be opened.\nThe fact that the script was intended to serve papers, and not to make all science free,\nwas critical, because it allowed the website to grow continuously for several years. If I tried\nto download millions of papers quickly (as Aaron Swartz tried to do) and then spread\nthem, I would have definitely failed from the start.\nJB: You're quickly becoming a hero of the open access movement. What's your\nguiding philosophy here?\nAE: There are two reasons I became inspired by open access. The first one is practical,\nbecause I myself did not have access to research papers I need. And the second is more\nphilosophical. I like the idea of communism, and the idea that knowledge should be\ncommon and not intellectual property is very relevant. That is especially true for\ninformation. Research articles are used for communication in science. But the word\n\"communication\" implies common ownership by itself.\n\"AS A DEVOUT PIRATE, I THINK THAT COPYRIGHT SHOULD\nBE ABOLISHED\"\nLater I became acquainted with the works of Robert K. Merton, the founder of sociology\nof science. Back in the first half of the 20th century Merton noticed that common\nownership of knowledge (i.e., communism) is one of the essential features of science that\nmakes it work. He found the concept of intellectual property to be self-contradictory.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 85-3 Filed 05/16/17 Page 4 of 6\nAs a devout pirate, I think that copyright should be abolished. At least some corrections to\nthe laws should be made that prohibit prosecutions or injunctions against free distribution\nof scientific knowledge and educational resources.\nThat is a different approach from the mainstream open access movement, which argues\nthat publishing models, not laws, should be amended. But the idea is the same.\nJB: What kinds of responses have you gotten to Sci-Hub?\nAE: Plenty of elaborate responses I got are in Russian, because we have an active\ncommunity here. I will translate a couple of them.\nI'm from I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University. It is a pleasure that wide spectrum of\ndomestic publications are available at the university library. But if we consider foreign ones, all is\nlimited to trivial PubMed access. The website is our everything.\nI study the evolution of IT with the emphasis on design principles, human-machine interfaces and etc.\nFor this invaluable was access to articles on PIM, UI/UX, starting from historical examples such as MIT\nDataland, VIKI, AUGMENT, HP NewWave, Xanadu, Raton Laveur and etc. and ending with current\nresearch. As result I became, I guess, the world-leading expert in this field. Thanks Sci-Hub for the\nhelp. I'm not going to forget it.\nI also got lots of negative feedback that concerned mainly the ideas and philosophy behind\nthe project, not the website operation itself. What is especially disliked is the relation to\ncommunism. There were plenty of politically motivated personal attacks. Since the project\nbecame popular there are haters too.\nJB: What's the status of the New York legal complaint, and have there been any other\nlegal challenges?\nAE: We got an injunction from US court, an order to stop our activities. A few weeks ago I\ngot an email that stated that another conference with court is scheduled for March,\nbecause our websites are operating despite receiving an injunction order. That means\nElsevier is going to develop the lawsuit further.\nJB: Are these legal challenges mostly from the United States?\nAE: At the moment, the US is the only government willing to shut down the site.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 85-3 Filed 05/16/17 Page 5 of 6\nJB: What do you think of the legal threats? Do you think you can run Sci-Hub\nindefinitely?\nAE: My goal is not only to make the website run indefinitely, but also to make its operation\nperfectly legal.\nJB: Who are the main users of Sci-Hub?\nAE: When I created Sci-Hub, I expected the tool to be used mainly by the general public.\nBut it turned out researchers themselves do not have access! When I once stopped the\nwebsite for a week, I got an interesting response from a Russian researcher where she\nasked me, \"When exactly is the website is going to be back? The work in my lab is stalled.\"\nMost paper downloads are coming from China, India, Russia, Brazil, Iran, and recently the\nUnited States joined the club. According to Yandex analytics, most people are 18 to 34\nyears old. The website is often used by students for their research projects.\nJB: You've cited the UN Charter (\"to share in scientific advancement and its\nbenefits\") to justify the site. Can you expand on your argument for why the site\nshould keep going?\nAE: The UN article says that a person cannot be excluded from participating in culture and\nscientific progress. I think that paywalls are doing just that, effectively excluding many\npeople. Subscription prices are very high; an individual person cannot pay them. To obtain\nlegal access, he or she needs to join one of the few available research institutions.\nBut how easy is that for a disabled person, for example? Or another individual who does\nnot conform to some standards, or simply is not ready to face the pressures that an\nacademic career demands?\nThe Sci-Hub is used by many independent researchers, including myself. But even most\ninstitutions do not have subscriptions needed for research. My university was one of them.\nJB: What would it take to shut you/the site down?\nAE: Though it is not possible to shut down the website completely, it is possible to force it\ninto the dark corners of the internet. All it takes is for a government motivated sufficiently\nto do that. Fortunately for us, the governments at this point are more interested in fighting\nterrorism than science, though both are defined as illegal.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 85-3 Filed 05/16/17 Page 6 of 6\nCorrection: This article originally misstated the date Sci-Hub launched its new domain.\nWas this article helpful?",

I am Global Litigation Counsel at Elsevier Inc. In that capacity, I am responsible\nfor and familiar with Elsevier’s copyright enforcement matters, including its investigation of and\nresponses to online piracy and content theft. My office is located at 360 Park Avenue South,\nNew York, New York 10010.\n3.

Elsevier’s ScienceDirect Platform\n4. Elsevier is the world’s leading publisher of peer-reviewed scholarly journals.\nElsevier currently publishes more than 2,500 scholarly journals and approximately 365,000\narticles annually in those journals. Elsevier is also a leading publisher of scholarly books,\npublishing approximately 33,000 books. Elsevier’s scholarly journals include world-renowned\npublications such as The Lancet and Cell.\n5. Elsevier operates “ScienceDirect,” an online platform through which users can\naccess the contents of Elsevier-published scientific, technical, engineering, and medical journals\nand book chapters. As of March 30, 2015, the ScienceDirect platform contains approximately\n12.3 million scientific journal articles and 33,000 books.\n6. Elsevier owns the copyrights in a substantial portion of the materials it makes\navailable through ScienceDirect. In addition, Elsevier is the exclusive licensee of the copyrights\nin a majority of the works on ScienceDirect in which it does not own the copyright.\n7. Elsevier, as a routine business practice, registers the copyrights in many of its\nscientific, technical, engineering, and medical books published in the United States with the U.S.\nCopyright Office. Elsevier also routinely registers the copyrights in its U.S. scientific journals\nwith the U.S. Copyright Office through serial registration.\n8. Elsevier B.V. owns the registered trademark in the ScienceDirect name. The\nmark was originally issued to Elsevier Science B.V. on February 23, 1999, and was transferred\nto Elsevier B.V. as a change of name on January 9, 2003. True and correct copies of the\nregistration certificate for the ScienceDirect mark and its assignment to Elsevier B.V. are\nattached hereto as Exhibit A.\n2\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 9 Filed 06/11/15 Page 3 of 7\nB. Elsevier Content Unlawfully Distributed By The Library Genesis Project and Sci-\nHub\n9. Elsevier has not at any time authorized the Library Genesis Project, Sci-Hub or\nAlexandra Elbakyan to distribute any of Elsevier’s copyrighted works through any channel,\nincluding through the libgen.org or sci-hub.org websites.\n10. Elsevier has attempted to have its copyrighted works removed from the Library\nGenesis Project through the use of “notice-and-takedown” demands as contemplated by the\nDigital Millennium Copyright Act, Title 17, United States Code, Section 512. The Library\nGenesis Project has routinely failed to remove Elsevier’s works from its repository in response to\nthese lawful demands.\n11. As part of its investigation into Defendants’ piracy, Elsevier has obtained from\nthe Library Genesis Project website databases containing bibliographic information concerning\nthe works distributed through the Library Genesis Project website. At my direction, an Elsevier\nemployee has reviewed a list of Elsevier-published titles which the Library Genesis Project\nclaims to make available to its users. Based on Elsevier’s regular practices, I can confirm that a\nsubstantial number of those works are those in which Elsevier owns federally-registered\ncopyrights.\n12. In order to verify that the Library Genesis Project is, in fact, distributing\nElsevier’s copyrighted works through the libgen.org website, on or about March 19, 2015, from\ncomputers located in the Southern District of New York, Elsevier officials acting at my direction\ndownloaded an article entitled “The Varus Ankle and Instability” from www.libgen.org.1 A true\nand correct copy of this article is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

I have reviewed the article and\nhave confirmed that the copy downloaded from libgen.org is identical to that legally available\nfrom ScienceDirect. A true and correct copy of Elsevier’s copyright registration covering the\narticle is attached hereto as Exhibit C.\n13. On or about March 19, 2015, from computers located in the Southern District of\nNew York, Elsevier officials acting at my direction also downloaded from the libgen.org website\na file containing chapter 84 of the Elsevier-published “Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical\nPhysiology.”2 A true and correct copy of this file is attached hereto as Exhibit D. This chapter\nis legally available to authorized users through ScienceDirect at the URL\nwww.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416045748000840. I have reviewed this file\nand have confirmed that the copy downloaded from libgen.org is identical to that legally\navailable from ScienceDirect. A true and correct copy of Elsevier’s copyright registration in the\nGuyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology, 12th Edition, is attached hereto as Exhibit E.\nC. The Irreparable and Public Harm caused by Defendants and the Need for\nInjunctive Relief\n14. In addition to the harm Sci-Hub and the Library Genesis Project cause to Elsevier\nand all other major scientific publishers directly as a result of their widespread and large scale\ninfringing activities, the Defendants’ activities also harm the scientific community as a whole.\nPublishers’ subscription and per-article fees sustain the scholarly publishing infrastructure,\nwhich is fundamental to the (1) dissemination and discovery of scientific research; (2) creation of\nnew journals and content in new and existing fields of research; (3) existence of a well-\nmaintained and definitive record of scientific discovery; and, (4) in some cases, even the\nacademic tenure process. By unlawfully and systematically distributing massive amounts of\n2 JOHN E. HALL, GUYTON AND HALL TEXTBOOK OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY (12th ed. 2011).\n4\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 9 Filed 06/11/15 Page 5 of 7\npublishers’ content without authorization, the Defendants are endangering this vital ecosystem\non which a thriving scientific community depends.\n15. The Defendants’ actions also threaten the quality of the materials relied upon by\nresearchers, scientists and medical practitioners who obtain scientific and medical publications\nthrough the publishers’ platforms. In particular, Elsevier and other scientific publishers take\ngreat care to correct or retract published journal articles and other information available on their\ndatabases which are later found to be erroneous or flawed. Scientists, researchers and doctors\nwho download articles from the Defendants’ websites may not have the advantage of this quality\ncontrol. Last year, for example, Elsevier alone made several thousand corrections to previously\npublished articles and retracted perhaps several hundred others.\n16. The possible harms resulting from an un-curated, rogue library, as Defendants are\ncreating and facilitating, is different from, and goes well beyond, the financial harm inflicted on\nElsevier and other publishers around the world as a result of Defendants’ illegal content\ndatabase.\n17. In the worst case, this could potentially threaten the safety or health of\nindividuals. For example, a scholarly work could be published with inaccurate information\nabout a drug or other scientific compound, or flawed research results. If a scientist, doctor or\nresearcher obtains the information legitimately, he or she will have access to the most current\nversion of a requested article, including any corrections, or will avoid being exposed to flawed\narticles that have been retracted. But that is not the case where content is obtained from an un-\ncurated source like the Library Genesis Project or Sci-Hub. By way of example, attached as\nExhibit F is a copy of a page from the ScienceDirect database illustrating the message displayed\n5\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 9 Filed 06/11/15 Page 6 of 7\nto readers when an article has been retracted, in this example because the article abstract\n“contained a drug dosage error which could have serious health consequences.”\n18. Elsevier has investigated the Library Genesis Project’s repository and has found\nthat its treatment of retractions is haphazard. In the worst case, retracted articles can be found in\nthe Library Genesis repository with no indication that a retraction has been issued. This appears\nto be the case with respect to the article “The Oncogenic Effects of Constitutive Stat3 Signaling\nin Salivary Gland Cancer Cells Are Mediated by Survivin and Modulated by the NSAID\nSulindac,” which was published in Elsevier’s Journal “Oral Surgery, Oral Medicine, Oral\nPathology, and Endodontology” in 2009. Although the article has since been retracted, the\nretraction notice does not appear in the Library Genesis Project repository, nor does there appear\nto be any other indication on the Library Genesis Project site that the article has been retracted or\nis in any way invalid.\n19. In other cases, the retraction is stored as a separate document, which may be\ndifficult to find or to connect to the retracted article. For example, if a Library Genesis Project\nUser searches for an article which was later retracted by the article’s original unique identifier\n(e.g., DOI), they would only locate the retracted article but not the notice that the article has been\nretracted. Moreover, if a user finds a retracted article using the Library Genesis Project’s\nkeyword search function, the retraction notice, even if present in the repository, may be difficult\nto locate in search results.\n20. Through my work with the Association of American Publishers’ Online Piracy\nWorking Group, I am aware that Defendants’ illegal piracy activities have harmed, and are\ncontinuing to harm, numerous other major publishers of scientific, medical and technical books\nand journals.\n6\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 9 Filed 06/11/15 Page 7 of 7",

However, interobserver reliability is very\nlow and is clearly surpassed when using a long axial view only.44 One of the\ndrawbacks of the hindfoot view is its susceptibility to rotatory malpositioning of the\nfoot.Thus,themeasurementsobtainedwiththehindfootviewneedtobeinterpreted\nwith caution.41 A far more reliable angle measurement can be done using the long\naxialvieworthemedialandlateralbordersofthecalcaneus.45\nWhereas preoperative assessment of hindfoot alignment under weight-bearing\nconditionsisdoneinastandardizedfashion,thereisnotyetatechniqueavailableto\ndo so under non–weight-bearing conditions, for example, during surgery.

In the presence of postural abnormalities or mechanical deformities, for\nexample in cavovarus foot, the value of a nonoperative treatment is questionable\nbecause it may not be effective enough in correcting rigid deformities and thus fail\nover time. However, some individuals will not allow themselves to be operated on,\nand for some, comorbidities increase health risks and outweigh the benefits of\nsurgery. This group includes elderly patients and those with inadequately regulated\ndiabetes mellitus, advanced peripheral vascular disease or cardiovascular disease,\nspecificneurologicdisorders,orrespiratorydisease.\nAlthough conservative treatment does not address the underlying cause of a\nmechanically induced varus hindfoot deformity, it might be beneficial in cases of\nflexiblevarusdeformityandwhenligamentousinsufficiencyhasbeenidentifiedasthe\nprimarycause.\nConservativetreatmentshouldbefollowedforupto6months.Ifafterastandard-\nizednonoperativeprotocolthereisnoimprovement,surgerymaybeconsidered.\nPhysicalTherapy\nPhysical therapy has been shown to influence functional instability by improving\nproprioception, peroneal muscle preactivation, and eversion strength.48–51 An ag-\ngressive stretching protocol is performed in order to lengthen the gastrocnemius-\nsoleusunitandtoreducetensionexertedthroughtheAchillestendon.Bysodoing,\ntheinversionmomentcanbereducedandstabilityimproved.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-04282-RWS Document 9-3 Filed 06/11/15 Page 10 of 26\n66 Klammeretal\nBraces\nBracescandecreaseseverityandfrequencyofanklesprainsinathleteswithchronic\ninstability.

In case of secondary\ndegenerative changes, rocker-bottom soles could alleviate pain by reducing the\npropulsiveworkattheanklejoint.\nAPPROACHING THE PATIENT WITH VARUS ANKLE AND INSTABILITY\nIt is beyond the scope of this article to discuss in detail each surgical treatment of\ncavovarus deformity. The authors instead present conceptual thoughts in order to\nexplain the approach to the patient with varus hindfoot deformity associated with\nchronicinstability.\nThe goal of any reconstructive type of surgery is to achieve a plantigrade, fully\nfunctional, and stable foot. In order to choose the adequate treatment (eg, osteoto-\nmies,ligamentreconstruction,fusions),surgeonsshouldidentifytheapexandrigidity\nof deformity, assess associated muscle imbalances, and evaluate involvement and\namountofjointdegeneration.\nWhenever possible, a joint-preserving approach should be considered.56–61 The\napex of deformity is found at the location where the malformation is most pro-\nnounced.Thus,forexample,inthecaseofahindfoot-drivencavovarus,theoriginis\nfoundatthehindfootwithvariabledeformitiesfoundatthemidfootandforefoot.\nTheapplicationofosteotomies,fusions,oracombinationofbothalwaysdepends\nontheseverityofdeformity.Normally,anobliqueorZ-shapedcalcanealosteotomy\nispowerfulenoughtorealigntheheelinrelationtothepullingvectoroftheAchilles\ntendon.Inmoreseverevarusdeformity,realignmentcouldbeachievedbymeansof\na laterally closing-wedge subtalar arthrodesis, and in extreme varus deformity\nsubtalarfusionshouldevenbecombinedwithalateralslidingcalcanealosteotomy.62\nIn cavovarus feet, the anteromedial part of the ankle is overloaded because of\ndeformity16,24 and chronic lateral ankle instability.12,13,63 A lateralizing calcaneal\nosteotomyunloadsthemedialanklecompartment64andmightbeconsideredinearly\nstages of ankle osteoarthritis.15 In contrast, subtalar arthrodesis exerts additional\nstrainontheanklejoint,whichalreadyhasorisatriskofdegeneration.56\nInahindfoot-drivencavovarusdeformitywithsubtlemidfootandforefootmalalign-\nment, additional osteotomies at the forefoot may be preventable. However, in most\ncases an excessively plantarflexed and rigid first ray with consecutively increased\nmedial arch and forefoot supination can be found.

At an average follow-up of 37 months, all patients were satisfied and\nAmerican Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot scores improved\nfrom 57 to 87 points.9 Conversely, Fortin and colleagues16 reported complete\nresolution of pain and improved stability in all patients who were treated by lateral\nankleligamentreconstructioncombinedwithrealignmentsurgery.\nWhereas functional instability in the absence of static hindfoot malalignment can\nsuccessfully be addressed by means of nonoperative measures,101,102 obvious\ndeformitiesneedsurgicalcorrection.Symptomsarerelievedbyhindfootrealignment\nin case of varus deformity without the need of additional ligament repair. In a\nretrospective series by Sammarco and Taylor60 of 21 ankles in 15 patients with\ncavovarus foot, 5 available for follow-up presented with instability as the primary\nconcern. All were treated with combined hindfoot and forefoot osteotomy for the\ncorrection of deformity.

This step might be followed by a medial release of the deltoid or distal\ntranslation of the medial malleolus.136,138 If the height of the tibial cut exceeds the\nmaximum thickness of the inlay, in other words if the varus deformity of the tibial\nplafond is greater than (5° to) 10°, an additional supramalleolar osteotomy is\nrequired.71,72 This situation corresponds to stage 1 varus ankle according to Frank\nAlvine’s classification. In stage 1, varus is induced by medial tibial erosion but\nabsenceofrelevantligamentinstability.139\nIn case of an anatomically oriented tibial plafond but incongruent talus within the\nmortise (talus tilts within mortise), the latter must first be restored. According to the\nAlvine classification, progression into stage 2 is characterized by lateral ligament\ninsufficiencyandmedialandlateralectopicboneformationthatmayinhibitanatomic\nplacementofthetaluswithinthemortise.Themedialandlateralguttersareliberated\nfrom osteophytes in order to allow realignment of the talus. Medial tightness may\ninhibit reduction.139 Thus, ligament balancing is done by releasing the deltoid\nligament or by performance of a medial malleolar lengthening osteotomy.138,139\nPersisting lateral ankle joint gaping of more than 5° requires an additional anatomic\nlateral ligament reconstruction as previously described.137 Alternatively, when liga-\nment insufficiency is caused by an overlong fibula or in the presence of subfibular\nimpingement,afibularshorteningosteotomycouldbeconsidered.136\nIn a well-aligned total ankle replacement with full restoration of joint congruence\nbut persisting hindfoot varus, further extraarticular correction is needed.136,138 This\ncorrectionmaybeachievedwithalateralslidingcalcanealosteotomyorwithsubtalar\nor triple arthrodesis, depending on joint degeneration or in case of Alvine stage 3\nvarus ankle (medial malleolar bone erosion combined with a subluxation of the\nsubtalarjoint).138,139\nSUMMARY\nVarusankleassociatedwithinstabilitycanbesimpleorcomplex.Multipleunderlying\ndiseasesmaycontributetothiscomplexpathologicentity.Theseconditionsshould\nbe recognized when attempting proper decision-making.
